	abstract = {We study empirical scaling laws for language model performance on the cross-entropy loss. The loss scales as a power-law with model size, dataset size, and the amount of compute used for training, with some trends spanning more than seven orders of magnitude. Other architectural details such as network width or depth have minimal effects within a wide range. Simple equations govern the dependence of overfitting on model/dataset size and the dependence of training speed on model size. These relationships allow us to determine the optimal allocation of a fixed compute budget. Larger models are significantly more sample-efficient, such that optimally compute-efficient training involves training very large models on a relatively modest amount of data and stopping significantly before convergence.},

The estimator is similar to one recently developed by Girard but satisfies a minimum variance criterion and does not require the simulation of a standard normal variable. It uses instead simulations of the discrete random variable which takes the values 1, -1 each with probability 1/2. Bounds on the variance of the estimator, similar to those established by Girard, are obtained using elementary methods. The estimator can be used to approximately minimize generalised cross validation (GCV) when using discretized iterative methods for fitting Laplacian smoothing splines to very large data sets. Simulated examples show that the estimated trace values, using either the estimator presented here or the estimator of Girard, perform almost as well as the exact values when applied to the minimization of GCV for n as small as a few hundred, where n is the number of data points.},

	abstract = {Advances in deep learning have greatly improved structure prediction of molecules. However, many macroscopic observations that are important for real-world applications are not functions of a single molecular structure, but rather determined from the equilibrium distribution of structures. Traditional methods for obtaining these distributions, such as molecular dynamics simulation, are computationally expensive and often intractable. In this paper, we introduce a novel deep learning framework, called Distributional Graphormer (DiG), in an attempt to predict the equilibrium distribution of molecular systems. Inspired by the annealing process in thermodynamics, DiG employs deep neural networks to transform a simple distribution towards the equilibrium distribution, conditioned on a descriptor of a molecular system, such as a chemical graph or a protein sequence. This framework enables efficient generation of diverse conformations and provides estimations of state densities. We demonstrate the performance of DiG on several molecular tasks, including protein conformation sampling, ligand structure sampling, catalyst-adsorbate sampling, and property-guided structure generation. DiG presents a significant advancement in methodology for statistically understanding molecular systems, opening up new research opportunities in molecular science.},

We demonstrate GaUDI’s effectiveness in designing molecules for organic electronic applications by using single- and multiple-objective tasks applied to a generated dataset of 475,000 polycyclic aromatic systems. GaUDI shows improved conditional design, generating molecules with optimal properties and even going beyond the original distribution to suggest better molecules than those in the dataset. In addition to point-wise targets, GaUDI can also be guided toward open-ended targets (for example, a minimum or maximum) and in all cases achieves close to 100\% validity of generated molecules. GaUDI is a guided diffusion method for the design of molecular structures that features a flexible and scalable target function and that achieves high validity of generated molecules.},

	url = {https://proceedings.mlr.press/v161/sannai21a.html},
	abstract = {Numerous invariant (or equivariant) neural networks have succeeded in handling the invariant data such as point clouds and graphs. However, a generalization theory for the neural networks has not been well developed, because several essential factors for the theory, such as network size and margin distribution, are not deeply connected to the invariance and equivariance. In this study, we develop a novel generalization error bound for invariant and equivariant deep neural networks. To describe the effect of invariance and equivariance on generalization, we develop a notion of a quotient feature space, which measures the effect of group actions for the properties. Our main result proves that the volume of quotient feature spaces can describe the generalization error. Furthermore, the bound shows that the invariance and equivariance significantly improves the leading term of the bound. We apply our result to a specific invariant and equivariant networks, such as DeepSets (Zaheer et al., NIPS 2017), and show that their generalization bound is considerably improved by n!−−√n!{\textbackslash}sqrt\{n!\}, where n!n!n! is the number of permutations. We also discuss the expressive power of invariant DNNs and show that they can achieve an optimal approximation rate. Moreover, we conducted experiments to support our results.},

The parametrization philosophy behind the force field focuses on quality at the expense of transferability, with the implementation concentrating on an extensible force field. Statistics related to the quality of the parametrization with a focus on experimental validation are presented. Additionally, the parametrization procedure, described fully in the present article in the context of the model systems, pyrrolidine, and 3-phenoxymethylpyrrolidine will allow users to readily extend the force field to chemical groups that are not explicitly covered in the force field as well as add functional groups to and link together molecules already available in the force field.

	abstract = {Recent successful generative models are trained by fitting a neural network to an a-priori defined tractable probability density path taking noise to training examples. In this paper we investigate the space of Gaussian probability paths, which includes diffusion paths as an instance, and look for an optimal member in some useful sense. In particular, minimizing the Kinetic Energy (KE) of a path is known to make particles’ trajectories simple, hence easier to sample, and empirically improve performance in terms of likelihood of unseen data and sample generation quality. We investigate Kinetic Optimal (KO) Gaussian paths and offer the following observations: (i) We show the KE takes a simplified form on the space of Gaussian paths, where the data is incorporated only through a single, one dimensional scalar function, called the data separation function. (ii) We characterize the KO solutions with a one dimensional ODE. (iii) We approximate data-dependent KO paths by approximating the data separation function and minimizing the KE. (iv) We prove that the data separation function converges to 111 in the general case of arbitrary normalized dataset consisting of 𝑛nn samples in 𝑑dd dimension as 𝑛/𝑑‾‾√→0n/d→0n/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{d\}{\textbackslash}rightarrow 0. A consequence of this result is that the Conditional Optimal Transport (Cond-OT) path becomes kinetic optimal as 𝑛/𝑑‾‾√→0n/d→0n/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{d\}{\textbackslash}rightarrow 0.

To address this question, we propose an approach based on a combination of the rare event sampling method called adaptive multilevel splitting (AMS) and ab initio molecular dynamics. The AMS method requires a one-dimensional reaction coordinate to index the progress of the transition. Identifying a good reaction coordinate is difficult, especially for high dimensional problems such as those encountered in catalysis. We probe various approaches to build reaction coordinates such as support vector machine and path collective variables. The AMS is implemented so as to communicate with a density functional theory-plane wave code. A relevant case study in catalysis, the change of conformation and the dissociation of a water molecule chemisorbed on the (100) γ-alumina surface, is used to evaluate our approach. The calculated rate constants and transition mechanisms are discussed and compared to those obtained by a conventional static approach based on the Eyring–Polanyi equation with harmonic approximation. It is revealed that the AMS method may provide rate constants that are smaller than those provided by the static approach by up to 2 orders of magnitude due to entropic effects involved in the chemisorbed water molecule.},

We recently found that cross-linked networks of actin filaments reconstituted in vitro can exhibit adaptive behavior and thus serve as a model system to understand the underlying mechanisms of mechanical adaptation of the cytoskeleton. In these networks, training, in the form of applied shear stress, can induce asymmetry in the nonlinear elasticity. Here, we explore control over this mechanical hysteresis by tuning the concentration and mechanical properties of cross-linking proteins in both experimental and simulated networks. We find that this effect depends on two conditions: the initial network must exhibit nonlinear strain stiffening, and filaments in the network must be able to reorient during training. Hysteresis depends strongly and non-monotonically on cross-linker concentration, with a peak at moderate concentrations. In contrast, at low concentrations, where the network does not strain stiffen, or at high concentrations, where filaments are less able to rearrange, there is little response to training. Additionally, we investigate the effect of changing cross-linker properties and find that longer or more flexible cross-linkers enhance hysteresis. Remarkably plotting hysteresis against alignment after training yields a single curve regardless of the physical properties or concentration of the cross-linkers.},

In statistical mechanics models, associative memory at equilibrium is represented through attractor basins in the free energy landscape. Here, we use the Hopfield model, a paradigmatic model to describe associate memory, to investigate the effect of non-equilibrium activity on memory retention and recall. We introduce activity into the system as gaussian-colored noise which breaks detailed balance and forces the system out of equilibrium. We observe that, under these non-equilibrium conditions, the Hopfield network has a higher storage capacity than that allowed at equilibrium. Using analytical and numerical techniques, we show that the rate of entropy production modifies the energy landscape and helps the system to access memory regions which were previously inaccessible.},

	abstract = {Quantifying entropy production in various active matter phases will open new avenues for probing self-organization principles in these far-from-equilibrium systems. It has been hypothesized that the dissipation of free energy by active matter systems may be optimized, leading to system trajectories with histories of large dissipation and an accompanying emergence of ordered dynamical states. This interesting idea has not been widely tested. In particular, it is not clear whether emergent states of actomyosin networks, which represent a salient example of biological active matter, self-organize following the principle of dissipation optimization. In order to start addressing this question using detailed computational modelling, we rely on the MEDYAN simulation platform, which allows simulating active matter networks from fundamental molecular principles. We have extended the capabilities of MEDYAN to allow quantification of the rates of dissipation resulting from chemical reactions and relaxation of mechanical stresses during simulation trajectories. This is done by computing precise changes in Gibbs free energy accompanying chemical reactions using a novel formula and through detailed calculations of instantaneous values of the system’s mechanical energy. We validate our approach with a mean-field model that estimates the rates of dissipation from filament treadmilling. Applying this methodology to the self-organization of small disordered actomyosin networks, we find that compact and highly cross-linked networks tend to allow more efficient transduction of chemical free energy into mechanical energy. In these simple systems, we observe that spontaneous network reorganizations tend to result in a decrease in the total dissipation rate to a low steady-state value. Future studies might carefully test whether the dissipation-driven adaptation hypothesis applies in this instance, as well as in more complex cytoskeletal geometries.},

	abstract = {Generating a Boltzmann distribution in high dimension has recently been achieved with Normalizing Flows, which enable fast and exact computation of the generated density, and thus unbiased estimation of expectations. However, current implementations rely on accurate training data, which typically comes from computationally expensive simulations. There is therefore a clear incentive to train models with incomplete or no data by relying solely on the target density, which can be obtained from a physical energy model (up to a constant factor). For that purpose, we analyze the properties of standard losses based on Kullback-Leibler divergences. We showcase their limitations, in particular a strong propensity for mode collapse during optimization on high-dimensional distributions. We then propose strategies to alleviate these issues, most importantly a new loss function well-grounded in theory and with suitable optimization properties. Using as a benchmark the generation of 3D molecular conﬁgurations, we show on several tasks that, for the ﬁrst time, imperfect pre-trained models can be further optimized in the absence of training data.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new paradigm for generative modeling built on Continuous Normalizing Flows (CNFs), allowing us to train CNFs at unprecedented scale. Specifically, we present the notion of Flow Matching (FM), a simulation-free approach for training CNFs based on regressing vector fields of fixed conditional probability paths. Flow Matching is compatible with a general family of Gaussian probability paths for transforming between noise and data samples---which subsumes existing diffusion paths as specific instances. Interestingly, we find that employing FM with diffusion paths results in a more robust and stable alternative for training diffusion models. Furthermore, Flow Matching opens the door to training CNFs with other, non-diffusion probability paths. An instance of particular interest is using Optimal Transport (OT) displacement interpolation to define the conditional probability paths. These paths are more efficient than diffusion paths, provide faster training and sampling, and result in better generalization. Training CNFs using Flow Matching on ImageNet leads to consistently better performance than alternative diffusion-based methods in terms of both likelihood and sample quality, and allows fast and reliable sample generation using off-the-shelf numerical ODE solvers.},

	abstract = {Deep neural networks can achieve remarkable generalization performances while interpolating the training data. Rather than the U-curve emblematic of the bias-variance trade-off, their test error often follows a "double descent"—a mark of the beneficial role of overparametrization. In this work, we develop a quantitative theory for this phenomenon in the so-called lazy learning regime of neural networks, by considering the problem of learning a high-dimensional function with random features regression. We obtain a precise asymptotic expression for the bias-variance decomposition of the test error, and show that the bias displays a phase transition at the interpolation threshold, beyond it which it remains constant. We disentangle the variances stemming from the sampling of the dataset, from the additive noise corrupting the labels, and from the initialization of the weights. We demonstrate that the latter two contributions are the crux of the double descent: they lead to the overfitting peak at the interpolation threshold and to the decay of the test error upon overparametrization. We quantify how they are suppressed by ensembling the outputs of 𝐾KK independently initialized estimators. For 𝐾→∞K→∞K{\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty, the test error is monotonously decreasing and remains constant beyond the interpolation threshold. We further compare the effects of overparametrizing, ensembling and regularizing. Finally, we present numerical experiments on classic deep learning setups to show that our results hold qualitatively in realistic lazy learning scenarios.},

Such reduced dynamics play an essential role in the study of a broad class of processes, ranging from chemical reactions in solution to conformational changes in biomolecules or phase transitions in condensed matter systems. The standard Markovian approximation often breaks down due to the lack of a proper separation of time scales, and memory effects must be taken into account. Using a parametrization based on hidden auxiliary variables, we obtain a generalized Langevin equation by maximizing the statistical likelihood of the observed trajectories. Both the memory kernel and random noise are correctly recovered by this procedure. This data-driven approach provides a reduced dynamical model for multidimensional collective variables, enabling the accurate sampling of their long-time dynamical properties at a computational cost drastically reduced with respect to all-atom numerical simulations. The present strategy, based on the reproduction of the dynamics of trajectories rather than the memory kernel or the velocity-autocorrelation function, conveniently provides other observables beyond these two, including, e.g., stationary currents in nonequilibrium situations or the distribution of first passage times between metastable states.},

	abstract = {Over the last decades, excellent computational chemistry tools have been developed. Their full potential has not yet been reached as most are challenging to learn and exist in isolation. Recently, large-language models (LLMs) have shown strong performance in tasks across domains, but struggle with chemistry-related problems. Moreover, these models lack access to external knowledge sources, limiting their usefulness in scientific applications. In this study, we introduce ChemCrow, an LLM chemistry agent designed to accomplish tasks across organic synthesis, drug discovery, and materials design. By integrating 17 expert-designed tools, ChemCrow augments the LLM performance in chemistry, and new capabilities emerge. Our agent autonomously planned the syntheses of an insect repellent, three organocatalysts, as well as other relevant molecules. Our evaluation, including both LLM and expert assessments, demonstrates ChemCrow's effectiveness in automating a diverse set of chemical tasks. Surprisingly, we find that GPT-4 as an evaluator cannot distinguish between clearly wrong GPT-4 completions and Chemcrow's performance. There is a significant risk of misuse of tools like ChemCrow, and we discuss their potential harms. Employed responsibly, our work not only aids expert chemists and lowers barriers for non-experts, but also fosters scientific advancement by bridging the gap between experimental and computational chemistry.

In recent years, this class of problems has seen a resurgence of research activities in control and machine learning communities. Different from the existing literature on the theory and computation for such problems, the controlled drift and diffusion coefficients for colloidal self-assembly are typically non-affine in control, and are difficult to obtain from physicsbased modeling. We deduce the conditions of optimality for such generalized problems, and show that the resulting system of equations is structurally very different from the existing results in a way that standard computational approaches no longer apply. Thus motivated, we propose a data-driven learning and control framework, named ‘neural Schro¨dinger bridge’, to solve such generalized Schro¨dinger bridge problems by innovating on recent advances in neural networks. We illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework using a numerical case study of colloidal self-assembly. We learn the controlled drift and diffusion coefficients as two neural networks using molecular dynamics simulation data, and then use these two to train a third network with Sinkhorn losses designed for distributional endpoint constraints, specific for this class of control problems.},

	abstract = {Many methods to accelerate sampling of molecular configurations are based on the idea that temperature can be used to accelerate rare transitions. These methods typically compute equilibrium properties at a target temperature using reweighting or through Monte Carlo exchanges between replicas at higher temperatures. A recent paper demonstrated that accurate equilibrium densities of states can also be computed through a nonequilibrium ``quench'' process, where sampling is performed at a higher temperature to encourage rapid mixing and then quenched to lower energy states with dissipative dynamics. Here we provide an implementation of the quench dynamics in LAMMPS and evaluate a new formulation of nonequilibrium estimators for the computation of partition functions or free energy surfaces (FESs) of molecular systems. We show that the method is exact for a minimal model of \$N\$-independent harmonic springs, and use these analytical results to develop heuristics for the amount of quenching required to obtain accurate sampling.= We then test the quench approach on alanine dipeptide, where we show that it gives an FES that is accurate near the most stable configurations using the quench approach, but disagrees with a reference umbrella sampling calculation in high FE regions. We then show that combining quenching with umbrella sampling allows the efficient calculation of the free energy in all regions. Moreover, by using this combined scheme, we obtain the FES across a range of temperatures at no additional cost, making it much more efficient than standard umbrella sampling if this information is required. Finally, we discuss how this approach can be extended to solute tempering and demonstrate that it is highly accurate for the case of solvated alanine dipeptide without any additional modifications.},

	abstract = {Variational inference (VI) is a method to approximate the computationally intractable posterior distributions that arise in Bayesian statistics. Typically, VI fits a simple parametric distribution to be close to the target posterior, minimizing an appropriate objective such as the evidence lower bound (ELBO). In this work, we present a new approach to VI. Our method is based on the principle of score matching, that if two distributions are equal then their score functions (i.e., gradients of the log density) are equal at every point on their support. With this principle, we develop score matching VI, an iterative algorithm that seeks to match the scores between the variational approximation and the exact posterior. At each iteration, score matching VI solves an inner optimization, one that minimally adjusts the current variational estimate to match the scores at a newly sampled value of the latent variables. We show that when the variational family is a Gaussian, this inner optimization enjoys a closed form solution, which we call Gaussian score matching VI (GSM-VI). GSM-VI is also a “black box” variational algorithm in that it only requires a differentiable joint distribution, and as such it can be applied to a wide class of models. We compare GSM-VI to black box variational inference (BBVI), which has similar requirements but instead optimizes the ELBO. We first study how GSM-VI behaves as a function of the problem dimensionality, the condition number of the target covariance matrix (when the target is Gaussian), and the degree of mismatch between the approximating and exact posterior distribution. We then study GSM-VI on a collection of real-world Bayesian inference problems from the posteriorDB database of datasets and models. In all of our studies we find that GSM-VI is faster than BBVI, but without sacrificing accuracy. It requires 10-100x fewer gradient evaluations to obtain a comparable quality of approximation1.},

However, these achievements have primarily depended on expensive, task-specific conditional training or error-prone heuristic approximations to them. Ideally, a conditional generation method should provide exact samples for a broad range of conditional distributions without requiring task-specific training. To this end, we introduce the Twisted Diffusion Sampler, or TDS, a sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm that targets the conditional distributions of diffusion models. The main idea is to use twisting, an SMC technique the enjoys good computational efficiency, to incorporate heuristic approximations without compromising asymptotic exactness. We study the properties of TDS on MNIST image inpainting and class-conditional generation tasks. TDS extends to Riemannian diffusion models, which are crucial for protein modeling. When applied to the motif-scaffolding problem, a core problem in protein design, TDS enables more flexible conditioning criteria than conditionally trained models, and provides state-of-the-art success rates on 9/12 problems in a benchmark set with scaffolds shorter than 100 residues.},

Using a projection operator formalism and computer simulations, we systematically derive generalized Langevin equations (GLEs) describing the dynamics of this particle. We compare different kinds of linear and non-linear coarse-graining procedures to understand how non-linearities enter reconstructed GLEs and how they influence the coarse-grained dynamics. For non-linear external potentials, we show analytically and numerically that the non-Gaussian parameter and the incoherent intermediate scattering function will not be correctly reproduced by the GLE if a linear projection is applied. This, however, can be overcome by using non-linear projection operators. We also study anharmonic coupling between the tracer and the environment and demonstrate that the reconstructed memory kernel develops an additional trap-dependent contribution. Our study highlights some open challenges and possible solutions in dynamic coarse graining.},

A theoretical analysis of the performance and understanding of the limitations of these methods remain, however, challenging. In this paper, we undertake a step in this direction by analysing the efficiency of sampling by these methods on a class of problems with a known probability distribution and comparing it with the sampling performance of more traditional methods such as the Monte Carlo Markov chain and Langevin dynamics. We focus on a class of probability distribution widely studied in the statistical physics of disordered systems that relate to spin glasses, statistical inference and constraint satisfaction problems. We leverage the fact that sampling via flow-based, diffusion-based or autoregressive networks methods can be equivalently mapped to the analysis of a Bayes optimal denoising of a modified probability measure. Our findings demonstrate that these methods encounter difficulties in sampling stemming from the presence of a first-order phase transition along the algorithm's denoising path. Our conclusions go both ways: we identify regions of parameters where these methods are unable to sample efficiently, while that is possible using standard Monte Carlo or Langevin approaches. We also identify regions where the opposite happens: standard approaches are inefficient while the discussed generative methods work well.},

In contrast, perturbing by nonconservative forces yields a nonequilibrium steady state, and the fluctuation-dissipation theorem can in general not be applied. Here we exploit a freedom inherent to linear response theory: Force fields which perform work that does not couple statistically to the considered observable can be added without changing the response. Using this freedom, we demonstrate that the fluctuation-dissipation theorem can be applied for certain nonconservative forces. We discuss the case of a nonconservative force field linear in particle coordinates, where the mentioned freedom can be formulated in terms of symmetries. In particular, for the case of shear, this yields a response formula, which we find advantageous over the known Green-Kubo relation in terms of statistical accuracy.},

Even though there is considerable interest in automating common procedure in analytical chemistry using machine learning, very few models have been adopted into everyday use. Among the analytical instruments available to chemists, Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy is one of the most important, offering insights into molecular structure unobtainable with other methods. However, most processing and analysis of NMR spectra is still performed manually, making the task tedious and time consuming especially for larger quantities of spectra. We present a transformer-based machine learning model capable of predicting the molecular structure directly from the NMR spectrum. Our model is pretrained on synthetic NMR spectra, achieving a top–1 accuracy of 67.0\% when predicting the structure from both the 1H and 13C spectrum. Additionally, we train a model which, given a spectrum and a set of likely compounds, selects the one corresponding to the spectrum. This model achieves a top–1 accuracy of 96.0\% when trained on 1H spectra.},

Recent work showed that such generative models can be utilized in statistical mechanics to sample equilibrium states of many-body systems in physics and chemistry. To scale and generalize these results, it is essential that the natural symmetries in the probability density – in physics defined by the invariances of the target potential – are built into the flow. We provide a theoretical sufficient criterion showing that the distribution generated by equivariant normalizing flows is invariant with respect to these symmetries by design. Furthermore, we propose building blocks for flows which preserve symmetries which are usually found in physical/chemical many-body particle systems. Using benchmark systems motivated from molecular physics, we demonstrate that those symmetry preserving flows can provide better generalization capabilities and sampling efficiency.},

From the one- and two-particle reduced density matrices of the monomer wavefunctions obtained by the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), we compute SAPT contributions to the interaction energy [SAPT(VQE)]. At first order, this energy yields the electrostatic and exchange contributions for non-covalently bound systems. We empirically find from ideal statevector simulations that the SAPT(VQE) interaction energy components display orders of magnitude lower absolute errors than the corresponding VQE total energies. Therefore, even with coarsely optimized low-depth VQE wavefunctions, we still obtain sub kcal mol−1 accuracy in the SAPT interaction energies. In SAPT(VQE), the quantum requirements, such as qubit count and circuit depth, are lowered by performing computations on the separate molecular systems. Furthermore, active spaces allow for large systems containing thousands of orbitals to be reduced to a small enough orbital set to perform the quantum portions of the computations. We benchmark SAPT(VQE) (with the VQE component simulated by ideal statevector simulators) against a handful of small multi-reference dimer systems and the iron center containing human cancer-relevant protein lysine-specific demethylase 5 (KDM5A).},

	abstract = {This paper considers estimation and prediction of a high-dimensional linear regression in the setting of transfer learning where, in addition to observations from the target model, auxiliary samples from different but possibly related regression models are available. When the set of informative auxiliary studies is known, an estimator and a predictor are proposed and their optimality is established. The optimal rates of convergence for prediction and estimation are faster than the corresponding rates without using the auxiliary samples. This implies that knowledge from the informative auxiliary samples can be transferred to improve the learning performance of the target problem. When the set of informative auxiliary samples is unknown, we propose a data-driven procedure for transfer learning, called Trans-Lasso, and show its robustness to non-informative auxiliary samples and its efficiency in knowledge transfer. The proposed procedures are demonstrated in numerical studies and are applied to a dataset concerning the associations among gene expressions. It is shown that Trans-Lasso leads to improved performance in gene expression prediction in a target tissue by incorporating data from multiple different tissues as auxiliary samples.},

We next establish a finite-sample minimax lower bound, propose a refined model interpolation estimator that enjoys a matching upper bound, and then extend our framework to multiple source domains and generalized linear models. Surprisingly, as long as information is available on the distance between the source and target parameters, negative-transfer does not occur. Simulation studies show that our proposed interpolation estimator outperforms state-of-the-art transfer learning methods in both moderate- and high-dimensional settings.},

In the present work, we re-think a solvable model of synthetic data as a framework for modeling correlation between data-sets. This setup allows for an analytic characterization of the generalization performance obtained when transferring the learned feature map from the source to the target task. Focusing on the problem of training two-layer networks in a binary classification setting, we show that our model can capture a range of salient features of transfer learning with real data. Moreover, by exploiting parametric control over the correlation between the two data-sets, we systematically investigate under which conditions the transfer of features is beneficial for generalization.},

Focusing the analysis on a solvable model that exhibits a non-trivial generalization gap, we investigate the effectiveness of KD. We are able to show that, through KD, the regularization properties of the larger teacher model can be inherited by the smaller student and that the yielded generalization performance is closely linked to and limited by the op- timality of the teacher.

This odd viscosity does not lead to energy dissipation, but gives rise to a flow perpendicular to applied pressure. We show how odd viscosity arises from non-linear equations of hydrodynamics with rotational degrees of freedom, once linearized around a non-equilibrium steady state characterized by large spinning speeds. Next, we explore odd viscosity in compressible fluids and suggest how our findings can be tested in the context of shock propagation experiments. Finally, we show how odd viscosity in weakly compressible chiral active fluids can lead to density and pressure excess within vortex cores.},

The complex and time-consuming calculations in molecular simulations are particularly suitable for an ML revolution and have already been profoundly affected by the application of existing ML methods. Here we review recent ML methods for molecular simulation, with particular focus on (deep) neural networks for the prediction of quantum-mechanical energies and forces, on coarsegrained molecular dynamics, on the extraction of free energy surfaces and kinetics, and on generative network approaches to sample molecular equilibrium structures and compute thermodynamics. To explain these methods and illustrate open methodological problems, we review some important principles of molecular physics and describe how they can be incorporated into ML structures. Finally, we identify and describe a list of open challenges for the interface between ML and molecular simulation.},

	abstract = {As part of the viral infection cycle, viruses must package their newly replicated genomes for delivery to other host cells. Bacteriophage φ29 packages its 6.6-µm long, double-stranded DNA into a 42 × 54 nm capsid1 by means of a portal complex that hydrolyses ATP2. This process is remarkable because entropic, electrostatic and bending energies of the DNA must be overcome to package the DNA to near-crystalline density. Here we use optical tweezers to pull on single DNA molecules as they are packaged, thus demonstrating that the portal complex is a force-generating motor. This motor can work against loads of up to 57 pN on average, making it one of the strongest molecular motors reported to date. Movements of over 5 µm are observed, indicating high processivity. Pauses and slips also occur, particularly at higher forces. We establish the force–velocity relationship of the motor and find that the rate-limiting step of the motor's cycle is force dependent even at low loads. Notably, the packaging rate decreases as the prohead is filled, indicating that an internal force builds up to ∼50 pN owing to DNA confinement. Our data suggest that this force may be available for initiating the ejection of the DNA from the capsid during infection.},

In metadynamics, sampling is accelerated by a history-dependent bias potential, which is adaptively constructed in the space of the CVs. Since its first appearance, significant improvements have been made to the original algorithm, leading to an efficient, flexible, and accurate method that has found many successful applications in several domains of science. Here, we discuss first the theory underlying metadynamics and its recent developments. In particular, we focus on the crucial issue of choosing an appropriate set of CVs and on the possible strategies to alleviate this difficulty.

The basic assumption is that the rare event used in the conditioning is a large deviation-type event, characterized by a convex rate function. Under this assumption, we construct the driven process via a generalization of Doob’s h-transform, used in the context of bridge processes, and show that this process is equivalent to the conditioned process in the long-time limit. The notion of equivalence that we consider is based on the logarithmic equivalence of path measures and implies that the two processes have the same typical states. In constructing the driven process, we also prove equivalence with the so-called exponential tilting of the Markov process, often used with importance sampling to simulate rare events and giving rise, from the point of view of statistical mechanics, to a nonequilibrium version of the canonical ensemble. Other links between our results and the topics of bridge processes, quasi-stationary distributions, stochastic control, and conditional limit theorems are mentioned.},

	abstract = {Fluctuation-dissipation relations (FDRs) connect the internal spontaneous fluctuations of a system with its response to an external perturbation. In this work we propose a nonlinear generalized FDR (NL FDR) as a test for Markovianity of the considered nonequilibrium system; i.e., the violation of the NL FDR indicates a non-Markovian process. Previously suggested FDRs are based on linear response and require a significant number of measurements. However, the nonlinear relation holds for systems out of equilibrium and for strong perturbations. Therefore, its verification requires significantly less data than the standard linear relation. We test the NL FDR for two theoretical model systems: a particle in a tilted periodic potential and a harmonically bound particle, each driven either by white noise (leading to Markovian test cases, which should obey the NL FDR) or by colored noise (resulting in non-Markovian systems, which may not obey the relation). The degree of violation is systematically explored for the non-Markovian variants of our theoretical models. For the particle in the harmonically bound potential, all statistical measures entering the NL FDR can be calculated explicitly and can be used to elucidate why the relation is violated in the non-Markovian case. In addition, we apply our formalism and test for Markovianity in an inherently out-of-equilibrium experimental system, a tracer particle, embedded in an active bath of self-propelled agents (bristlebots) and subject to a force applied by an external air stream. An experimental violation of the NL FDR is witnessed by introducing an additional timescale to the process, when using bristlebots with two metastable speed states.},

To study the ring constriction dynamics, we develop a model that includes the driving force of crosslinker condensation and the opposing forces of friction and filament bending. We analyze the constriction force as a function of ring topology and crosslinker concentration, and predict forces that are sufficient to constrict an unadorned plasma membrane. Our model also predicts that actin-filament sliding arises from an interplay between filament rotation and crosslinker hopping, producing frictional forces that are low compared with those of crosslinker-mediated microtubule sliding.},

Previous work have shown its convergence to the unique minimizer via non-quantitative arguments. We prove that this dynamics converges at an exponential rate, under the assumption that a certain family of Log-Sobolev inequalities holds. This assumption holds for instance for the minimization of the risk of certain two-layer neural networks, where NPGD is equivalent to standard noisy gradient descent. We also study the annealed dynamics, and show that for a noise decaying at a logarithmic rate, the dynamics converges in value to the global minimizer of the unregularized objective function.},

In this work, we give a concise and self-contained convergence rate analysis of the mean ﬁeld Langevin dynamics with respect to the (regularized) objective function in both continuous and discrete time settings. The key ingredient of our proof is a proximal Gibbs distribution pq associated with the dynamics, which, in combination with techniques in Vempala and Wibisono (2019), allows us to develop a simple convergence theory parallel to classical results in convex optimization. Furthermore, we reveal that pq connects to the duality gap in the empirical risk minimization setting, which enables eﬃcient empirical evaluation of the algorithm convergence.},

Such hybrid quantum-classical algorithms are popular for applications in quantum simulation, optimization, and machine learning. Due to its simplicity and hardware efficiency, random circuits are often proposed as initial guesses for exploring the space of quantum states. We show that the exponential dimension of Hilbert space and the gradient estimation complexity make this choice unsuitable for hybrid quantum-classical algorithms run on more than a few qubits. Specifically, we show that for a wide class of reasonable parameterized quantum circuits, the probability that the gradient along any reasonable direction is non-zero to some fixed precision is exponentially small as a function of the number of qubits. We argue that this is related to the 2-design characteristic of random circuits, and that solutions to this problem must be studied.},

	abstract = {Lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) are a clinically mature technology for the delivery of genetic medicines but have limited therapeutic applications due to liver accumulation. Recently, our laboratory developed selective organ targeting (SORT) nanoparticles that expand the therapeutic applications of genetic medicines by enabling delivery of messenger RNA (mRNA) and gene editing systems to non-liver tissues. SORT nanoparticles include a supplemental SORT molecule whose chemical structure determines the LNP’s tissue-specific activity. To understand how SORT nanoparticles surpass the delivery barrier of liver hepatocyte accumulation, we studied the mechanistic factors which define their organ-targeting properties. We discovered that the chemical nature of the added SORT molecule controlled biodistribution, global/apparent pKa, and serum protein interactions of SORT nanoparticles. Additionally, we provide evidence for an endogenous targeting mechanism whereby organ targeting occurs via 1) desorption of poly(ethylene glycol) lipids from the LNP surface, 2) binding of distinct proteins to the nanoparticle surface because of recognition of exposed SORT molecules, and 3) subsequent interactions between surface-bound proteins and cognate receptors highly expressed in specific tissues. These findings establish a crucial link between the molecular composition of SORT nanoparticles and their unique and precise organ-targeting properties and suggest that the recruitment of specific proteins to a nanoparticle’s surface can enable drug delivery beyond the liver.},

Targeting of systemically administered lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) coformulated with mRNA has largely been confined to the liver and spleen. Using a library screening approach, we identified that N-series LNPs (containing an amide bond in the tail) are capable of selectively delivering mRNA to the mouse lung, in contrast to our previous discovery that O-series LNPs (containing an ester bond in the tail) that tend to deliver mRNA to the liver. We analyzed the protein corona on the liver- and lung-targeted LNPs using liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry and identified a group of unique plasma proteins specifically absorbed onto the surface that may contribute to the targetability of these LNPs. Different pulmonary cell types can also be targeted by simply tuning the headgroup structure of N-series LNPs. Importantly, we demonstrate here the success of LNP-based RNA therapy in a preclinical model of lymphangioleiomyomatosis (LAM), a destructive lung disease caused by loss-of-function mutations in the Tsc2 gene. Our lung-targeting LNP exhibited highly efficient delivery of the mouse tuberous sclerosis complex 2 (Tsc2) mRNA for the restoration of TSC2 tumor suppressor in tumor and achieved remarkable therapeutic effect in reducing tumor burden.

The resulting potentials are accurate and robust for the wide range of configurations that occur during structure searching, despite only requiring a relatively small number of single-point DFT calculations on small unit cells.

As a result, many high-dimensional sampling and approximation problems once thought intractable are being revisited through the lens of machine learning. While the promise of unparalleled accuracy may suggest a renaissance for applications that require parameterizing representations of complex systems, in many applications gathering sufficient data to develop such a representation remains a significant challenge. Here we introduce an approach that combines rare events sampling techniques with neural network train- ing to optimize objective functions that are dominated by rare events. We show that importance sampling reduces the asymptotic variance of the solution to a learning problem, suggesting benefits for generalization. We study our algorithm in the context of solving high-dimensional PDEs that admit a variational formulation, a problem with applications in statistical physics and implications in machine learning theory. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that we can successfully learn even with the compounding difficulties of high-dimension and rare data.},

	abstract = {From the point of view of statistical mechanics, a full characterization of a molecular system requires an accurate determination of its possible states, their populations, and the respective interconversion rates. Toward this goal, well-established methods increase the accuracy of molecular dynamics simulations by incorporating experimental information about states using structural restraints and about populations using thermodynamics restraints. However, it is still unclear how to include experimental knowledge about interconversion rates. Here, we introduce a method of imposing known rate constants as constraints in molecular dynamics simulations, which is based on a combination of the maximum-entropy and maximum-caliber principles. Starting from an existing ensemble of trajectories, obtained from either molecular dynamics or enhanced trajectory sampling, this method provides a minimally perturbed path distribution consistent with the kinetic constraints, as well as modified free energy and committor landscapes. We illustrate the application of the method to a series of model systems, including all-atom molecular simulations of protein folding. Our results show that by combining experimental rate constants and molecular dynamics simulations, this approach enables the determination of transition states, reaction mechanisms, and free energies. We anticipate that this method will extend the applicability of molecular simulations to kinetic studies in structural biology and that it will assist the development of force fields to reproduce kinetic and thermodynamic observables. Furthermore, this approach is generally applicable to a wide range of systems in biology, physics, chemistry, and material science.},

	abstract = {To interpret simulations of a complex system to determine the physical mechanism of a dynamical process, it is necessary to identify the small number of coordinates that distinguish the stable states from the transition states. We develop an automatic method for identifying these degrees of freedom from a database of candidate physical variables. In the method neural networks are used to determine the functional dependence of the probability of committing to a stable state (committor) on a set of coordinates, and a genetic algorithm selects the combination of inputs that yields the best fit. The method enables us to obtain the first set of coordinates that is demonstrably sufficient to specify the transition state of the C7eq→ αR isomerization of the alanine dipeptide in the presence of explicit water molecules. It is revealed that the solute−solvent coupling can be described by a solvent-derived electrostatic torque around one of the main-chain bonds, and the collective, long-ranged nature of this interaction accounts for previous failures to characterize this reaction.},

One of the most promising applications is the construction of ML-based force fields (FFs), with the aim to narrow the gap between the accuracy of ab initio methods and the efficiency of classical FFs. The key idea is to learn the statistical relation between chemical structure and potential energy without relying on a preconceived notion of fixed chemical bonds or knowledge about the relevant interactions. Such universal ML approximations are in principle only limited by the quality and quantity of the reference data used to train them. This review gives an overview of applications of ML-FFs and the chemical insights that can be obtained from them. The core concepts underlying ML-FFs are described in detail, and a step-by-step guide for constructing and testing them from scratch is given. The text concludes with a discussion of the challenges that remain to be overcome by the next generation of ML-FFs.},

Despite the enormous success of deep learning, relatively little is understood theoretically about why these techniques are so successful at feature learning and compression. Here, we show that deep learning is intimately related to one of the most important and successful techniques in theoretical physics, the renormalization group (RG). RG is an iterative coarse-graining scheme that allows for the extraction of relevant features (i.e. operators) as a physical system is examined at different length scales. We construct an exact mapping from the variational renormalization group, first introduced by Kadanoff, and deep learning architectures based on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs). We illustrate these ideas using the nearest-neighbor Ising Model in one and two-dimensions. Our results suggests that deep learning algorithms may be employing a generalized RG-like scheme to learn relevant features from data.},

              Proteins are essential to life, and understanding their structure can facilitate a mechanistic understanding of their function. Through an enormous experimental effort

              , the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined

              6,7
              . Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’

Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known.

	abstract = {Diffusion plays a crucial role in many biological processes including signaling, cellular organization, transport mechanisms, and more. Direct observation of molecular movement by single-particle-tracking experiments has contributed to a growing body of evidence that many cellular systems do not exhibit classical Brownian motion but rather anomalous diffusion. Despite this evidence, characterization of the physical process underlying anomalous diffusion remains a challenging problem for several reasons. First, different physical processes can exist simultaneously in a system. Second, commonly used tools for distinguishing between these processes are based on asymptotic behavior, which is experimentally inaccessible in most cases. Finally, an accurate analysis of the diffusion model requires the calculation of many observables because different transport modes can result in the same diffusion power-law a, which is typically obtained from the mean-square displacements (MSDs). The outstanding challenge in the ﬁeld is to develop a method to extract an accurate assessment of the diffusion process using many short trajectories with a simple scheme that is applicable at the nonexpert level. Here, we use deep learning to infer the underlying process resulting in anomalous diffusion. We implement a neural network to classify single-particle trajectories by diffusion type: Brownian motion, fractional Brownian motion and continuous time random walk. Further, we demonstrate the applicability of our network architecture for estimating the Hurst exponent for fractional Brownian motion and the diffusion coefﬁcient for Brownian motion on both simulated and experimental data. These networks achieve greater accuracy than time-averaged MSD analysis on simulated trajectories while only requiring as few as 25 steps. When tested on experimental data, both net and ensemble MSD analysis converge to similar values; however, the net needs only half the number of trajectories required for ensemble MSD to achieve the same conﬁdence interval. Finally, we extract diffusion parameters from multiple extremely short trajectories (10 steps) using our approach.},

The method does not rely on a previous knowledge of the transition states or reaction coordinates, as long as collective variables are known that can distinguish between the various stable minima in free energy space. We demonstrate that our method recovers the correct escape rates out of these stable states and also preserves the correct sequence of state-to-state transitions, with minimal extra computational effort needed over ordinary metadynamics.

While both remain very difficult, predictions of kinetics are particularly difficult because rates, in contrast to free energies, depend on the route taken. For this reason, specific enhanced sampling methods are needed to calculate long-time scale kinetics. It has recently been demonstrated that it is possible to recover kinetics through the so-called “infrequent metadynamics” simulations, where the simulations are biased in a way that minimally corrupts the dynamics of moving between metastable states. This method, however, requires the bias to be added slowly, thus hampering applications to processes with only modest separations of time scales. Here we present a frequency-adaptive strategy which bridges normal and infrequent metadynamics. We show that this strategy can improve the precision and accuracy of rate calculations at fixed computational cost and should be able to extend rate calculations for much slower kinetic processes.},

Like the earlier hyperdynamics strategy, iMetaD enables estimates of the unbiased escape rates. However, iMetaD applies the bias to visited locations in a collective variable (CV) space, not to the more specific visited locations in a full configuration space as done in hyperdynamics. This difference makes rate estimates from iMetaD sensitive to the choice of CVs, to parameters that control the bias deposition rate, and to the preparation of the initial state within the reactant basin. This paper uses an extremely simple discrete state model to illustrate complications that can arise in systems that exhibit fluxional transitions between sub-basins of the reactant state. Specifically, we show how the reactant-to-product escape time and relaxation times within the reactant basin(s) impose bounds on the admissible parameter choices for an iMetaD calculation. Predictions from the discrete state model are validated by iMetaD simulations on a corresponding two-dimensional potential energy surface.},

Early in the folding process, the protein backbone adopts a nativelike topology while certain secondary structure elements and a small number of nonlocal contacts form.

However, because of the large spatial and temporal scales of thermodynamic and kinetic phenomena in materials, atomistic simulations are often computationally infeasible. Coarse-graining methods allow larger systems to be simulated by reducing their dimensionality, propagating longer timesteps, and averaging out fast motions. Coarse-graining involves two coupled learning problems: defining the mapping from an all-atom representation to a reduced representation, and parameterizing a Hamiltonian over coarse-grained coordinates. We propose a generative modeling framework based on variational auto-encoders to unify the tasks of learning discrete coarse-grained variables, decoding back to atomistic detail, and parameterizing coarse-grained force fields.

Yet, learning attentions in generative flows remains understudied, while it has made breakthroughs in other domains. To fill the gap, this paper introduces two types of invertible attention mechanisms, i.e., map-based and transformer-based attentions, for both unconditional and conditional generative flows. The key idea is to exploit a masked scheme of these two attentions to learn long-range data dependencies in the context of generative flows. The masked scheme allows for invertible attention modules with tractable Jacobian determinants, enabling its seamless integration at any positions of the flow-based models. The proposed attention mechanisms lead to more efficient generative flows, due to their capability of modeling the long-term data dependencies. Evaluation on multiple image synthesis tasks shows that the proposed attention flows result in efficient models and compare favorably against the state-of-the-art unconditional and conditional generative flows.},

However, they typically rely on aphysical hybrid regions to maintain numerical stability when high-resolution degrees of freedom (DOFs) are randomly re-inserted at the resolution interface. We propose an Energy Minimized AT (DOF) Insertion (EMATI) method that uses an informed rather than random AT DOF insertion to tackle the root cause of the issue, i.e., overlapping AT potentials. EMATI enables us to directly couple AT and coarse-grained resolutions without any modifications of the interaction potentials. We exemplify AdResS-EMATI in a system of liquid butane and show that it yields improved structural and thermodynamic properties at the interface compared to competing AdResS approaches. Furthermore, our approach extends the applicability of the AdResS without a hybrid region to systems for which force capping is inadequate.},

	abstract = {One ongoing topic of research in MD simulations is how to enable sampling to chemically and biologically relevant time scales. We address this question by introducing a back-mapping based sampling (BMBS) that combines multiple aspects of different sampling techniques. BMBS uses coarse grained (CG) free energy surfaces (FESs) and dimensionality reduction to initiate new atomistic simulations. These new simulations are started from atomistic conformations that were back-mapped from CG points all over the FES in order to sample the entire accessible phase space as fast as possible. In the context of BMBS, we address relevant back-mapping related questions like where to start the back-mapping from and how to judge the atomistic ensemble that results from the BMBS. The latter is done with the use of the earth mover’s distance, which allows us to quantitatively compare distributions of CG and atomistic ensembles. By using this metric, we can also show that the BMBS is able to correct inaccuracies of the CG model. In this paper, BMBS is applied to a just recently introduced neural network (NN) based approach for a radical coarse graining to predict free energy surfaces for oligopeptides. The BMBS scheme back-maps these FESs to the atomistic scale, justifying and complementing the proposed NN based CG approach. The efficiency benefit of the algorithm scales with the length of the oligomer. Already for the heptamers, the algorithm is about one order of magnitude faster in sampling compared to a standard MD simulation.},

	abstract = {Representation learning of graph-structured data is challenging because both graph structure and node features carry important information. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) provide an expressive way to fuse information from network structure and node features. However, GNNs are prone to adversarial attacks. Here we introduce Graph Information Bottleneck (GIB), an information-theoretic principle that optimally balances expressiveness and robustness of the learned representation of graph-structured data. Inheriting from the general Information Bottleneck (IB), GIB aims to learn the minimal sufficient representation for a given task by maximizing the mutual information between the representation and the target, and simultaneously constraining the mutual information between the representation and the input data. Different from the general IB, GIB regularizes the structural as well as the feature information. We design two sampling algorithms for structural regularization and instantiate the GIB principle with two new models: GIB-Cat and GIB-Bern, and demonstrate the benefits by evaluating the resilience to adversarial attacks. We show that our proposed models are more robust than state-of-the-art graph defense models. GIB-based models empirically achieve up to 31\% improvement with adversarial perturbation of the graph structure as well as node features.},

Adding fluctuations, we find that static colonies are now metastable, moving between spatial locations via rare and strongly nonequilibrium pathways, whereas the limit cycle becomes almost periodic such that after each redispersion event the next colony forms in a random location. These results, which hint at some aspects of the biofilm-planktonic life cycle, can be explained by combining tools from large deviation theory with a bifurcation analysis in which the global population density plays the role of control parameter.},

In our approach, the parameters of the model are explicitly trained such that a small number of gradient steps with a small amount of training data from a new task will produce good generalization performance on that task. In effect, our method trains the model to be easy to fine-tune.

The latter are ubiquitous in physicochemical and biological applications, where they are typically associated with coupling mechanisms, multi-physics and/or boundary conditions. In general the non-equilibrium steady states are not known explicitly as they do not necessarily have a Gibbs structure. The presented approach can compare microscopic behavior of molecular systems to parametric and non-parametric coarse-grained models using the relative entropy between distributions on the path space and setting up a corresponding path-space variational inference problem. The methods can become entirely data-driven when the microscopic dynamics are replaced with corresponding correlated data in the form of time series. Furthermore, we present connections and generalizations of force matching methods in coarse-graining with path-space information methods. We demonstrate the enhanced transferability of information-based parameterizations to different observables, at a specific thermodynamic point, due to information inequalities. We discuss methodological connections between information-based coarse-graining of molecular systems and variational inference methods primarily developed in the machine learning community. However, we note that the work presented here addresses variational inference for correlated time series due to the focus on dynamics. The applicability of the proposed methods is demonstrated on high-dimensional stochastic processes given by overdamped and driven Langevin dynamics of interacting particles.},

We introduce a generalized force matching condition for the local mean force in the sense that allows the approximation of the potential of mean force under both linear and non-linear coarse graining mappings (e.g., reaction coordinates, end-to-end length of chains). Furthermore, we study the equivalence of force matching with relative entropy minimization which we derive for general non-linear coarse graining maps.

	abstract = {Many systems in nature and the synthetic world involve ordered arrangements of units on two-dimensional surfaces. We review here the fundamental role payed by both the topology of the underlying surface and its detailed curvature. Topology dictates certain broad features of the defect structure of the ground state but curvature-driven energetics controls the detailed structured of ordered phases. Among the surprises are the appearance in the ground state of structures that would normally be thermal excitations and thus prohibited at zero temperature. Examples include excess dislocations in the form of grain boundary scars for spherical crystals above a minimal system size, dislocation unbinding for toroidal hexatics, interstitial fractionalization in spherical crystals and the appearance of well-separated disclinations for toroidal crystals. Much of the analysis leads to universal predictions that do not depend on the details of the microscopic interactions that lead to order in the first place. These predictions are subject to test by the many experimental soft and hard matter systems that lead to curved ordered structures such as colloidal particles self-assembling on droplets of one liquid in a second liquid. The defects themselves may be functionalized to create ligands with directional bonding. Thus nano to meso scale superatoms may be designed with specific valency for use in building supermolecules and novel bulk materials. Parameters such as particle number, geometrical aspect ratios and anisotropy of elastic moduli permit the tuning of the precise architecture of the superatoms and associated supermolecules. Thus the field has tremendous potential from both a fundamental and materials science/supramolecular chemistry viewpoint.},

	abstract = {Biological membranes typically contain a large number of different components dispersed in small concentrations in the main membrane phase, including proteins, sugars, and lipids of varying geometrical properties. Most of these components do not bind the cargo. Here, we show that such “inert” components can be crucial for the precise control of cross-membrane trafficking. Using a statistical mechanics model and molecular dynamics simulations, we demonstrate that the presence of inert membrane components of small isotropic curvatures dramatically influences cargo endocytosis, even if the total spontaneous curvature of such a membrane remains unchanged. Curved lipids, such as cholesterol, as well as asymmetrically included proteins and tethered sugars can, therefore, actively participate in the control of the membrane trafficking of nanoscopic cargo. We find that even a low-level expression of curved inert membrane components can determine the membrane selectivity toward the cargo size and can be used to selectively target membranes of certain compositions. Our results suggest a robust and general method of controlling cargo trafficking by adjusting the membrane composition without needing to alter the concentration of receptors or the average membrane curvature. This study indicates that cells can prepare for any trafficking event by incorporating curved inert components in either of the membrane leaflets.},

	abstract = {A computational technique is proposed which combines the string method with a sampling technique to determine minimum free energy paths. The technique only requires to compute the mean force and another conditional expectation locally along the string, and therefore can be applied even if the number of collective variables kept in the free energy calculation is large. This is in contrast with other free energy sampling techniques which aim at mapping the full free energy landscape and whose cost increases exponentially with the number of collective variables kept in the free energy. Provided that the number of collective variables is large enough, the new technique captures the mechanism of transition in that it allows to determine the committor function for the reaction and, in particular, the transition state region. The new technique is illustrated on the example of alanine dipeptide, in which we compute the minimum free energy path for the isomerization transition using either two or four dihedral angles as collective variables. It is shown that the mechanism of transition can be captured using the four dihedral angles, but it cannot be captured using only two of them.},

However, there are still unmet needs in improving the delivery of biologics. Injectable polymeric nanoparticles and microparticles capable of releasing proteins and peptides over time periods as long as weeks or months have been a major focus in the effort to decrease the frequency of administration. These particle systems ﬁt broadly into two categories: those composed of hydrophilic and those composed of hydrophobic polymeric scaffolds. Here we review the factors that contribute to the slow and controlled release from each class of particle, as well as the effects of synthesis parameters and product design on the loading, encapsulation efﬁciency, biologic integrity, and release proﬁle. Generally, hydrophilic scaffolds are ideal for large proteins while hydrophobic scaffolds are more appropriate for smaller biologics without secondary structure. Here we also introduce a Flash NanoPrecipitation method that has been adopted for encapsulating biologics in nanoparticles (40–200 nm) at high loadings (50–75 wt.\%) and high encapsulation efﬁciencies. The hydrophilic gel interior and hydrophobic shell provide an opportunity to combine the best of both classes of injectable polymeric depots.},

Their areas of application span topics in economics, finance, game theory, industrial engineering, crowd motion, and more. In this paper, we provide a flexible machine learning framework for the numerical solution of potential MFG and MFC models. State-of-the-art numerical methods for solving such problems utilize spatial discretization that leads to a curse of dimensionality. We approximately solve high-dimensional problems by combining Lagrangian and Eulerian viewpoints and leveraging recent advances from machine learning. More precisely, we work with a Lagrangian formulation of the problem and enforce the underlying Hamilton–Jacobi–Bellman (HJB) equation that is derived from the Eulerian formulation. Finally, a tailored neural network parameterization of the MFG/MFC solution helps us avoid any spatial discretization. Our numerical results include the approximate solution of 100-dimensional instances of optimal transport and crowd motion problems on a standard work station and a validation using a Eulerian solver in two dimensions. These results open the door to much-anticipated applications of MFG and MFC models that are beyond reach with existing numerical methods.},

	abstract = {Cryptic allosteric sites—transient pockets in a folded protein that are invisible to conventional experiments but can alter enzymatic activity via allosteric communication with the active site—are a promising opportunity for facilitating drug design by greatly expanding the repertoire of available drug targets. Unfortunately, identifying these sites is difficult, typically requiring resource-intensive screening of large libraries of small molecules. Here, we demonstrate that Markov state models built from extensive computer simulations (totaling hundreds of microseconds of dynamics) can identify prospective cryptic sites from the equilibrium fluctuations of three medically relevant proteins—β-lactamase, interleukin-2, and RNase H—even in the absence of any ligand. As in previous studies, our methods reveal a surprising variety of conformations—including bound-like configurations—that implies a role for conformational selection in ligand binding. Moreover, our analyses lead to a number of unique insights. First, direct comparison of simulations with and without the ligand reveals that there is still an important role for an induced fit during ligand binding to cryptic sites and suggests new conformations for docking. Second, correlations between amino acid sidechains can convey allosteric signals even in the absence of substantial backbone motions. Most importantly, our extensive sampling reveals a multitude of potential cryptic sites—consisting of transient pockets coupled to the active site—even in a single protein. Based on these observations, we propose that cryptic allosteric sites may be even more ubiquitous than previously thought and that our methods should be a valuable means of guiding the search for such sites.},

            Hydrophobic effects, which play a crucial role in many chemical and biological processes, originate in the statistics of microscopic density fluctuations in liquid water. Chandler has established the foundation for a simple and unified understanding of these effects, by identifying essential aspects of water’s intermolecular structure while accounting for its proximity to phase coexistence. Here, we show that coarse-grained models based on this perspective, when constructed to include the statistics of capillary waves at interfaces, can achieve remarkable agreement with results of atomistically detailed simulations. Highly efficient and lacking adjustable parameters, such models hold promise as powerful tools for studying multiscale problems in hydrophobic solvation.
          , 
            
              Modern theories of the hydrophobic effect highlight its dependence on length scale, emphasizing the importance of interfaces in the vicinity of sizable hydrophobes. We recently showed that a faithful treatment of such nanoscale interfaces requires careful attention to the statistics of capillary waves, with significant quantitative implications for the calculation of solvation thermodynamics. Here, we show that a coarse-grained lattice model like that of Chandler [Chandler D (2005)
              Nature
              437(7059):640–647], when informed by this understanding, can capture a broad range of hydrophobic behaviors with striking accuracy. Specifically, we calculate probability distributions for microscopic density fluctuations that agree very well with results of atomistic simulations, even many SDs from the mean and even for probe volumes in highly heterogeneous environments. This accuracy is achieved without adjustment of free parameters, because the model is fully specified by well-known properties of liquid water. As examples of its utility, we compute the free-energy profile for a solute crossing the air–water interface, as well as the thermodynamic cost of evacuating the space between extended nanoscale surfaces. These calculations suggest that a highly reduced model for aqueous solvation can enable efficient multiscale modeling of spatial organization driven by hydrophobic and interfacial forces.},

	abstract = {When a physical system is driven away from equilibrium, the statistical distribution of its dynamical trajectories informs many of its physical properties. Characterizing the nature of the distribution of dynamical observables, such as a current or entropy production rate, has become a central problem in nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Asymptotically, for a broad class of observables, the distribution of a given observable satisfies a large deviation principle when the dynamics is Markovian, meaning that fluctuations can be characterized in the long-time limit by computing a scaled cumulant generating function. Calculating this function is not tractable analytically (nor often numerically) for complex, interacting systems, so the development of robust numerical techniques to carry out this computation is needed to probe the properties of nonequilibrium materials. Here, we describe an algorithm that recasts this task as an optimal control problem that can be solved variationally. We solve for optimal control forces using neural network ansatz that are tailored to the physical systems to which the forces are applied. We demonstrate that this approach leads to transferable and accurate solutions in two systems featuring large numbers of interacting particles.},

We compare the physics of these two model systems both at microscopic and macroscopic scales. Using exact results for their steady-state distribution in the presence of external potentials, we show that they both admit the same effective equilibrium regime perturbatively that breaks down for stronger external potentials, in a model-dependent way. In the presence of collisional repulsions such particles slow down at high density: their propulsive effort is unchanged, but their average speed along u becomes v(ρ) {\textless} v. A fruitful avenue is then to construct a mean-field description in which particles are ghost-like and have no collisions, but swim at a variable speed v that is an explicit function or functional of the density ρ. We give numerical evidence that the recently shown equivalence of the fluctuating hydrodynamics of ABPs and RTPs in this case, which we detail here, extends to microscopic models of ABPs and RTPs interacting with repulsive forces.},

	abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6\% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes—although the greatest effects are in small (n ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

Thus, light-driven particles have become a recent focus of research in the field of soft active matter. In this Perspective, we discuss recent advances in the control of soft active matter with light, which has mainly been achieved using light intensity. We also highlight some first attempts to utilize light’s additional properties, such as its wavelength, polarization, and momentum. We then argue that fully exploiting light with all of its properties will play a critical role in increasing the level of control over the actuation of active matter as well as the flow of light itself through it. This enabling step will advance the design of soft active matter systems, their functionalities, and their transfer toward technological applications.},

Computational and mathematical models at the continuum level have been used to investigate the molecular clutch mechanism, calculating the stress profile through the lamellipodium and around focal adhesions. However, the forces and deformations of individual actin filaments have not been considered while interactions between actin networks and actin bundles is not easily accounted with such methods. We develop a filament-level model of a lamellipodial actin network undergoing retrograde flow using 3D Brownian dynamics. Retrograde flow is promoted in simulations by pushing forces from the leading edge (due to actin polymerization), pulling forces (due to molecular motors), and opposed by viscous drag in cytoplasm and focal adhesions. Simulated networks have densities similar to measurements in prior electron micrographs. Connectivity between individual actin segments is maintained by permanent and dynamic crosslinkers. Remodeling of the network occurs via the addition of single actin filaments near the leading edge and via filament bond severing. We investigated how several parameters affect the stress distribution, network deformation and retrograde flow speed. The model captures the decrease in retrograde flow upon increase of focal adhesion strength. The stress profile changes from compression to extension across the leading edge, with regions of filament bending around focal adhesions. The model reproduces the observed reduction in retrograde flow speed upon exposure to cytochalasin D, which halts actin polymerization. Changes in crosslinker concentration and dynamics, as well as in the orientation pattern of newly added filaments demonstrate the model’s ability to generate bundles of filaments perpendicular (actin arcs) or parallel (microspikes) to the protruding direction.},

Because of the large system size and processes that involve flexible regions and diffuse components, simulations of branch formation using all-atom molecular dynamics are challenging. We applied a coarse-grained model that retains amino-acid level information and allows molecular dynamics simulations in implicit solvent, with globular domains represented as rigid bodies and flexible regions allowed to fluctuate. We used recent electron microscopy structures of the inactive Arp2/3 complex bound to NPF domains and to mother actin filament for the activated Arp2/3 complex. We studied interactions of Arp2/3 complex with the activating VCA domain of the NPF Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome protein, actin monomers, and actin filament. We found stable configurations with one or two actin monomers bound along the branch filament direction and with CA domain of VCA associated to the strong and weak binding sites of the Arp2/3 complex, supporting prior structural studies and validating our approach. We reproduced delivery of actin monomers and CA to the Arp2/3 complex under different conditions, providing insight into mechanisms proposed in previous studies. Simulations of active Arp2/3 complex bound to a mother actin filament indicate the contribution of each subunit to the binding. Addition of the C-terminal tail of Arp2/3 complex subunit ArpC2, which is missing in the cryo-EM structure, increased binding affinity, indicating a possible stabilizing role of this tail.},

            We present a comprehensive study about the relationship between the way detailed balance is broken in non-equilibrium systems and the resulting violations of the fluctuation–dissipation theorem. Starting from stochastic dynamics with both odd and even variables under time-reversal, we derive an explicit expression for the time-reversal operator, i.e. the Markovian operator which generates the time-reversed trajectories. We then exploit the relation between entropy production and the breakdown of detailed balance to establish general constraints on the non-equilibrium steady-states (NESS), which relate the non-equilibrium character of the dynamics with symmetry properties of the NESS distribution. This provides a direct route to derive extended fluctuation–dissipation relations, expressing the linear response function in terms of NESS correlations. Such framework provides a unified way to understand the departure from equilibrium of active systems and its linear response. We then consider two paradigmatic models of interacting self-propelled particles, namely active Brownian particles and active Ornstein–Uhlenbeck particles. We analyze the non-equilibrium character of these systems (also within a Markov and a Chapman–Enskog approximation) and derive extended fluctuation–dissipation relations for them, clarifying which features of these active model systems are genuinely non-equilibrium.},

	abstract = {Biological systems present a powerful, yet largely untapped, opportunity to impart autonomous regulation to materials. Because these systems can function robustly to regulate when and where chemical reactions occur, they have the ability to bring complex, life-like behavior to synthetic materials. Here, we achieve this design feat by using functionalized circadian clock proteins, KaiB and KaiC, to engineer time-dependent crosslinking of colloids. The resulting material selfassembles with programmable kinetics, producing macroscopic changes in material properties, via molecular assembly of KaiB-KaiC complexes. We show that colloid crosslinking depends strictly on the phosphorylation state of KaiC, with kinetics that are synced with KaiB-KaiC complexing. Our microscopic image analyses and computational models indicate that self-assembly of colloidal super-structures requires multiple Kai complexes per colloid connection, which then stabilizes the material against dissolution. This work introduces the concept of harnessing biological timers to control synthetic materials; and, more generally, opens the door to using protein-based reaction networks to endow synthetic systems with life-like functional properties.},

	abstract = {The adaptive and surprising emergent properties of biological materials self-assembled in far-from-equilibrium environments serve as an inspiration for efforts to design nanomaterials and their properties. In particular, controlling the conditions of self-assembly can modulate material properties, but there is no systematic understanding of either how to parameterize this control or how {\textbackslash}emph\{controllable\} a given material can be. Here, we demonstrate that branched actin networks can be encoded with {\textbackslash}textit\{metamaterial\} properties by dynamically controlling the applied force under which they grow, and that the protocols can be selected using multi-task reinforcement learning. These actin networks have tunable responses over a large dynamic range depending on the chosen external protocol, providing a pathway to encoding ``memory'' within these structures. Interestingly, we show that encoding memory requires dissipation and the rate of encoding is constrained by the flow of entropy -- both physical and information theoretical. Taken together, these results emphasize the utility and necessity of nonequilibrium control for designing self-assembled nanostructures.},

To illustrate the approach, we present results for two model systems: all-atom alanine dipeptide and coarse-grained src homology 3 protein domain. We provide clear physical interpretation for the emerging coordinates and use them to calculate transition rates. The technique is general enough to be applied to any system for which a Boltzmann-sampled set of molecular configurations is available.},

To address this, enhanced sampling methods have been developed to improve exploration of configurational space. However, implementing these is challenging and requires domain expertise. In recent years, integration of machine learning (ML) techniques in different domains has shown promise, prompting their adoption in enhanced sampling as well. Although ML is often employed in various fields primarily due to its data-driven nature, its integration with enhanced sampling is more natural with many common underlying synergies. This review explores the merging of ML and enhanced MD by presenting different shared viewpoints. It offers a comprehensive overview of this rapidly evolving field, which can be difficult to stay updated on. We highlight successful strategies like dimensionality reduction, reinforcement learning, and flow-based methods. Finally, we discuss open problems at the exciting ML-enhanced MD interface.},

	abstract = {The lamellipodium of migrating animal cells protrudes by directed polymerization of a branched actin network. The underlying mechanisms of filament growth, branching, and capping can be studied in in vitro assays. However, conflicting results have been reported for the force–velocity relation of such actin networks, namely both convex and concave shapes as well as history dependencies. Here we model branching as a reaction that is independent of the number of existing filaments, in contrast to capping, which is assumed to be proportional to the number of existing filaments. Using both stochastic network simulations and deterministic rate equations, we show that such a description naturally leads to the stability of two qualitatively different stationary states of the system, namely a ± 35° and a +70/0/-70° orientation pattern. Changes in network growth velocity induce a transition between these two patterns. For sufficiently different protrusion efficiency of the two network architectures, this leads to hysteresis in the growth velocity of actin networks under force. Dependent on the history of the system, convex and concave regimes are obtained for the force–velocity relation. Thus a simple generic model can explain the experimentally observed anomalies, with far reaching consequences for cell migration.},

	abstract = {The leading edge of motile cells is propelled by polymerization of actin filaments according to a dendritic nucleation/array treadmilling mechanism. However, little attention has been given to the origin and maintenance of the dendritic array. Here we develop and test a population-kinetics model that explains the organization of actin filaments in terms of the reproduction of dendritic units. The life cycle of an actin filament consists of dendritic nucleation on another filament (birth), elongation by addition of actin subunits and, finally, termination of filament growth by capping protein (death). The regularity of branch angle between daughter and mother filaments endows filaments with heredity of their orientation. Fluctuations of branch angle that become fixed in the actin network create errors of orientation (mutations) that may be inherited. In our model, birth and death rates depend on filament orientation, which then becomes a selectable trait. Differential reproduction and elimination of filaments, or natural selection, leads to the evolution of a filament pattern with a characteristic distribution of filament orientations. We develop a procedure based on the Radon transform for quantitatively analyzing actin networks in situ and show that the experimental results are in agreement with the distribution of filament orientations predicted by our model. We conclude that the propulsive actin network can be understood as a self-organizing supramolecular ensemble shaped by the evolution of dendritic lineages through natural selection of their orientation.},

Overall, digital tool use had a positive effect on student learning outcomes (g = 0.65, p {\textless} .001). The provision of teacher trainings on digital tool use significantly moderated the overall effect. Use of intelligent tutoring systems or simulations such as dynamic mathematical tools was significantly more beneficial than hypermedia systems.

We tested these self-reported survey results with direct observations of teaching using the Reformed Teaching Observation Protocol, and we conducted interviews to understand what aspects of Cutting Edge have supported change. Survey data show that teaching strategies involving active learning have become more common, that these practices are concentrated in faculty who invest in learning about teaching, and that faculty investment in learning about teaching has increased. Regression analysis shows that, after controlling for other key influences, faculty who have participated in Cutting Edge programs and who regularly use resources on the Cutting Edge website are statistically more likely to use active learning teaching strategies. Cutting Edge participants also report that learning about teaching, the availability of teaching resources, and interactions with peers have supported changes in their teaching practice. Our data suggest that even one-time participation in a workshop with peers can lead to improved teaching by supporting a combination of affective and cognitive learning outcomes.},

Advances in the synthesis of environmentally-responsive materials therefore open up the possibility of creating a wide range of synthetic materials which can also be trained for adaptability. We consider high-dimensional inverse problems for materials where any particular functionality can be realized by numerous equivalent choices of design parameters. By periodically switching targets in a given design algorithm, we can teach a material to perform incompatible functionalities with minimal changes in design parameters. We exhibit this learning strategy for adaptability in two simulated settings: elastic networks that are designed to switch deformation modes with minimal bond changes; and heteropolymers whose folding pathway selections are controlled by a minimal set of monomer affinities. The resulting designs can reveal physical principles, such as nucleation-controlled folding, that enable adaptability.},

	abstract = {Memory formation in matter is a theme of broad intellectual relevance; it sits at the interdisciplinary crossroads of physics, biology, chemistry, and computer science. Memory connotes the ability to encode, access, and erase signatures of past history in the state of a system. Once the system has completely relaxed to thermal equilibrium, it is no longer able to recall aspects of its evolution. The memory of initial conditions or previous training protocols will be lost. Thus many forms of memory are intrinsically tied to far-from-equilibrium behavior and to transient response to a perturbation. This general behavior arises in diverse contexts in condensed-matter physics and materials, including phase change memory, shape memory, echoes, memory effects in glasses, return-point memory in disordered magnets, as well as related contexts in computer science. Yet, as opposed to the situation in biology, there is currently no common categorization and description of the memory behavior that appears to be prevalent throughout condensed-matter systems. Here the focus is on material memories. The basic phenomenology of a few of the known behaviors that can be understood as constituting a memory will be described. The hope is that this will be a guide toward developing the unifying conceptual underpinnings for a broad understanding of memory effects that appear in materials.},

Our method, VoxMol, generates molecules in a fundamentally different way than the current state of the art (i.e., diffusion models applied to atom point clouds). It differs in terms of the data representation, the noise model, the network architecture and the generative modeling algorithm. VoxMol achieves comparable results to state of the art on unconditional 3D molecule generation while being simpler to train and faster to generate molecules.},

	abstract = {Peptide self-assembly plays a role in a number of diseases, in pharmaceutical degradation, and in emerging biomaterials. Here, we aim to develop an accurate molecular-scale picture of this process using a multiscale computational approach. Recently, Shell (Shell, M. S. J. Chem. Phys.2008, 129, 144108-7) developed a coarse-graining methodology that is based on a thermodynamic quantity called the relative entropy, a measure of how different two molecular ensembles behave. By minimizing the relative entropy between a coarse-grained peptide system and a reference all-atom system, with respect to the coarse-grained model’s force field parameters, an optimized coarse-grained model can be obtained. We have reformulated this methodology using a trajectory-reweighting and perturbation strategy that enables complex coarse-grained models with at least hundreds of parameters to be optimized efficiently. This new algorithm allows for complex peptide systems to be coarse-grained into much simpler models that nonetheless recapitulate many correct features of detailed all-atom ones. In particular, we present results for a polyalanine case study, with attention to both individual peptide folding and large-scale fibril assembly.},

	abstract = {Understanding the phase behavior of polyelectrolyte coacervation is crucial for many applications, including consumer formulations, wet adhesives, processed food, and drug delivery. However, in most cases, modeling coacervation is not easily accessed by molecular simulation methods due to the long-range nature of electrostatic forces and the typically high molecular weights of the species involved. We present a modeling strategy to study complex coacervation leveraging the strengths of both particle simulations and polymer field theory. Field theory is uniquely suited to capture larger-length scales that are inaccessible to particle simulations, but its predictive capability is limited by the need to specify emergent parameters. Using model coacervate-forming systems consisting of poly(acrylic acid) and poly(allylamine hydrochloride), we show an original way to use small-scale, all-atom simulations to parameterize field-theoretic models via the relative entropy coarse-graining approach. The dependence of coacervation on the salt concentration, molecular weight, and charge stoichiometry is predicted without fitting to experimental data and is consistent with experimental trends including asymmetric phase behavior from non-stoichiometric mixtures of polyelectrolytes. This demonstrates a unique simulation approach to study phase behavior in coacervate-forming systems, which is particularly useful when chemical specificity is of interest.},

Recent x-ray structures of ADP-bound G-actin (G-ADP) by Otterbein et al. [Otterbein, L. R., Graceffa, P. \& Dominguez, R.

Chem. 278, 34172–34180] indicate that the DB loop of actin does not have a well defined secondary structure in the ATP state but folds into an α-helix in the ADP state. MD simulations and CG analysis indicate that such a helical DB loop significantly weakens the intermonomer interactions of actin assemblies and thus leads to a wider, shorter, and more disordered filament. The computed persistence lengths of F-actin composed of G-ATP (16 μm) and of G-ADP (8.5 μm) agree well with the experimental values for the two states. Therefore, the loop-to-helix transition of the DB loop may be one of the factors that lead to the changes in structural and mechanical properties of F-actin after ATP hydrolysis. This result may provide a direct connection between the conformational changes of an actin monomer and the structural and mechanical properties of the cytoskeleton. The information provided by MD simulations also helps to understand the possible origin of the special features of actin dynamics.},

We ﬁnd in general that the form of efﬁciency probability distributions is similar to those described by Verley et al (2014 Nat.

In contrast to the time-symmetric engine protocols studied previously, however, this minimum need not occur at the value characteristic of a reversible Carnot engine. Furthermore, while the local minimum may reside at the global minimum of a large deviation rate function, it does not generally correspond to the least likely efﬁciency measured over ﬁnite time. We introduce a general approximation for the ﬁnite-time efﬁciency distribution, P (η), based on large deviation statistics of work and heat, that remains very accurate even when P (η) deviates signiﬁcantly from its large deviation form.},

Our method adapts generative adversarial networks (GANs) to operate directly on graph-structured data. We combine our approach with a reinforcement learning objective to encourage the generation of molecules with speciﬁc desired chemical properties. In experiments on the QM9 chemical database, we demonstrate that our model is capable of generating close to 100\% valid compounds.

            A tight and consistent link between resolutions is crucial to further expand the impact of multiscale modeling for complex materials. We herein tackle the generation of condensed molecular structures as a refinement—backmapping—of a coarse-grained (CG) structure. Traditional schemes start from a rough coarse-to-fine mapping and perform further energy minimization and molecular dynamics simulations to equilibrate the system. In this study we introduce DeepBackmap: A deep neural network based approach to directly predict equilibrated molecular structures for condensed-phase systems. We use generative adversarial networks to learn the Boltzmann distribution from training data and realize reverse mapping by using the CG structure as a conditional input. We apply our method to a challenging condensed-phase polymeric system. We observe that the model trained in a melt has remarkable transferability to the crystalline phase. The combination of data-driven and physics-based aspects of our architecture help reach temperature transferability with only limited training data.},

The algorithm embeds the trajectory of the Markov chain into a reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), such that the feature space covariance of the samples informs the choice of proposal. The procedure is computationally efficient and straightforward to implement, since the RKHS moves can be integrated out analytically: our proposal distribution in the original space is a normal distribution whose mean and covariance depend on where the current sample lies in the support of the target distribution, and adapts to its local covariance structure. Furthermore, the procedure requires neither gradients nor any other higher order information about the target, making it particularly attractive for contexts such as Pseudo-Marginal MCMC. Kernel Adaptive Metropolis-Hastings outperforms competing fixed and adaptive samplers on multivariate, highly nonlinear target distributions, arising in both real-world and synthetic examples.},

As a result, many high-dimensional sampling and approximation problems once thought intractable are being revisited through the lens of machine learning. While the promise of unparalleled accuracy may suggest a renaissance for applications that require parameterizing representations of complex systems, in many applications gathering sufficient data to develop such a representation remains a significant challenge. Here we introduce an approach that combines rare events sampling techniques with neural network optimization to optimize objective functions that are dominated by rare events. We show that importance sampling reduces the asymptotic variance of the solution to a learning problem, suggesting benefits for generalization. We study our algorithm in the context of learning dynamical transition pathways between two states of a system, a problem with applications in statistical physics and implications in machine learning theory. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that we can successfully learn even with the compounding difficulties of high-dimension and rare data.},

            The structure of the carboxysome resembles a viral capsid, but, unlike many viruses, the monomers of its shell do not appear to fit together in a uniquely preferred way. As a result, the size and shape of this bacterial microcompartment must be determined by the dynamics of its self-assembly process. Using theory and simulation of a model system, we show that the mechanism of assembling such a structure can proceed through nonequilibrium dynamics that are both reliable and controllable. We identify experimentally tunable parameters that modulate the shape and size of the assembled structure, advancing strategies to repurpose natural microcompartments and to create synthetic mimics.

            Cyanobacteria sequester photosynthetic enzymes into microcompartments which facilitate the conversion of carbon dioxide into sugars. Geometric similarities between these structures and self-assembling viral capsids have inspired models that posit microcompartments as stable equilibrium arrangements of the constituent proteins. Here we describe a different mechanism for microcompartment assembly, one that is fundamentally nonequilibrium and yet highly reliable. This pathway is revealed by simulations of a molecular model resolving the size and shape of a cargo droplet and the extent and topography of an elastic shell. The resulting metastable microcompartment structures closely resemble those of carboxysomes, with a narrow size distribution and faceted shells. The essence of their assembly dynamics can be understood from a simpler mathematical model that combines elements of classical nucleation theory with continuum elasticity. These results highlight important control variables for achieving nanoscale encapsulation in general and for modulating the size and shape of carboxysomes in particular.},

	abstract = {Mechanical cues affect many important biological processes in metazoan cells, such as migration, proliferation, and differentiation. Such cues are thought to be detected by specialized mechanosensing molecules linked to the cytoskeleton, an intracellular network of protein filaments that provide mechanical rigidity to the cell and drive cellular shape change. The most abundant such filament, actin, forms branched networks nucleated by the actin-related protein (Arp) 2/3 complex that support or induce membrane protrusions and display adaptive behavior in response to compressive forces. Here we show that filamentous actin serves in a mechanosensitive capacity itself, by biasing the location of actin branch nucleation in response to filament bending. Using an in vitro assay to measure branching from curved sections of immobilized actin filaments, we observed preferential branch formation by the Arp2/3 complex on the convex face of the curved filament. To explain this behavior, we propose a fluctuation gating model in which filament binding or branch nucleation by Arp2/3 occur only when a sufficiently large, transient, local curvature fluctuation causes a favorable conformational change in the filament, and we show with Monte Carlo simulations that this model can quantitatively account for our experimental data. We also show how the branching bias can reinforce actin networks in response to compressive forces. These results demonstrate how filament curvature can alter the interaction of cytoskeletal filaments with regulatory proteins, suggesting that direct mechanotransduction by actin may serve as a general mechanism for organizing the cytoskeleton in response to force.},

	abstract = {Here we propose the reweighted autoencoded variational Bayes for enhanced sampling (RAVE) method, a new iterative scheme that uses the deep learning framework of variational autoencoders to enhance sampling in molecular simulations. RAVE involves iterations between molecular simulations and deep learning in order to produce an increasingly accurate probability distribution along a low-dimensional latent space that captures the key features of the molecular simulation trajectory. Using the Kullback-Leibler divergence between this latent space distribution and the distribution of various trial reaction coordinates sampled from the molecular simulation, RAVE determines an optimum, yet nonetheless physically interpretable, reaction coordinate and optimum probability distribution. Both then directly serve as the biasing protocol for a new biased simulation, which is once again fed into the deep learning module with appropriate weights accounting for the bias, the procedure continuing until estimates of desirable thermodynamic observables are converged. Unlike recent methods using deep learning for enhanced sampling purposes, RAVE stands out in that (a) it naturally produces a physically interpretable reaction coordinate, (b) is independent of existing enhanced sampling protocols to enhance the fluctuations along the latent space identified via deep learning, and (c) it provides the ability to easily filter out spurious solutions learned by the deep learning procedure. The usefulness and reliability of RAVE is demonstrated by applying it to model potentials of increasing complexity, including computation of the binding free energy profile for a hydrophobic ligand–substrate system in explicit water with dissociation time of more than 3 min, in computer time at least twenty times less than that needed for umbrella sampling or metadynamics.},

Accurate treatment of correlation effects is therefore integral to the design and development of materials consisting of (for example) charged gels, block copolymers, and biopolymers. In this Talents article, recent theoretical developments useful for understanding correlations are discussed. This understanding can shape the development of new materials, exposing new opportunities in precise, sequence-based control over charge correlations in polymers and their emerging role in charge-driven self-assembly.},

	abstract = {We propose a method for identifying accurate reaction coordinates among a set of trial coordinates. The method applies to special cases where motion along the reaction coordinate follows a one-dimensional Smoluchowski equation. In these cases the reaction coordinate can predict its own short-time dynamical evolution, i.e., the dynamics projected from multiple dimensions onto the reaction coordinate depend only on the reaction coordinate itself. To test whether this property holds, we project an ensemble of short trajectory swarms onto trial coordinates and compare projections of individual swarms to projections of the ensemble of swarms. The comparison, quantified by the Kullback-Leibler divergence, is numerically performed for each isosurface of each trial coordinate. The ensemble of short dynamical trajectories is generated only once by sampling along an initial order parameter. The initial order parameter should separate the reactants and products with a free energy barrier, and distributions on isosurfaces of the initial parameter should be unimodal. The method is illustrated for three model free energy landscapes with anisotropic diffusion. Where exact coordinates can be obtained from Kramers-Langer-Berezhkovskii-Szabo theory, results from the new method agree with the exact results. We also examine characteristics of systems where the proposed method fails. We show how dynamical self-consistency is related (through the Chapman-Kolmogorov equation) to the earlier isocommittor criterion, which is based on longer paths.},

Unfortunately, these conditions are not always fulfilled. To overcome these limitations, and inspired by single-molecule force spectroscopy, we use Kramers’ theory for calculating the barrier-crossing rate when a time-dependent bias is added to the system. We assess the ef f iciency of collective variables parameter by measuring how efficiently the bias accelerates the transitions. We present approximate analytical expressions of the survival probability, reproducing the barrier-crossing time statistics and enabling the extraction of the unbiased transition rate even for challenging cases. We explore the limits of our method and provide convergence criteria to assess its validity.},

	abstract = {Arp2/3 complex nucleates branched actin filaments that provide pushing forces to drive cellular processes such as lamellipodial protrusion and endocytosis. Arp2/3 complex is intrinsically inactive, and multiple classes of nucleation promoting factors (NPFs) stimulate its nucleation activity. When activated by WASP family NPFs, the complex must bind to the side of a preexisting (mother) filament of actin to complete the nucleation process, ensuring that WASP-mediated activation creates branched rather than linear actin filaments. How actin filaments contribute to activation is currently not understood, largely due to the lack of high-resolution structures of activated Arp2/3 complex bound to the side of a filament. Here, we present the 3.9-Å cryo-electron microscopy structure of the Arp2/3 complex at a branch junction. The structure reveals contacts between Arp2/3 complex and the side of the mother actin filament that likely stimulate subunit flattening, a conformational change that allows the actin-related protein subunits in the complex (Arp2 and Arp3) to mimic filamentous actin subunits. In contrast, limited contact between the bottom half of the complex and the mother filament suggests that clamp twisting, a second major conformational change observed in the active state, is not stimulated by actin filaments, potentially explaining why actin filaments are required but insufficient to trigger nucleation during WASP-mediated activation. Along with biochemical and live-cell imaging data and molecular dynamics simulations, the structure reveals features critical for the interaction of Arp2/3 complex with actin filaments and regulated assembly of branched actin filament networks in cells.},

We demonstrate that such methods enable well-behaved exchange-correlation approximations in very flexible model spaces, thus avoiding the overfitting found when standard least-squares methods are applied to high-order polynomial expansions. A general-purpose density functional for surface science and catalysis studies should accurately describe bond breaking and formation in chemistry, solid state physics, and surface chemistry, and should preferably also include van der Waals dispersion interactions. Such a functional necessarily compromises between describing fundamentally different types of interactions, making transferability of the density functional approximation a key issue. We investigate this trade-off between describing the energetics of intramolecular and intermolecular, bulk solid, and surface chemical bonding, and the developed optimization method explicitly handles making the compromise based on the directions in model space favored by different materials properties. The approach is applied to designing the Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF–vdW), a semilocal approximation with an additional nonlocal correlation term. Furthermore, an ensemble of functionals around BEEF–vdW comes out naturally, offering an estimate of the computational error. An extensive assessment on a range of data sets validates the applicability of BEEF–vdW to studies in chemistry and condensed matter physics. Applications of the approximation and its Bayesian ensemble error estimate to two intricate surface science problems support this.},

We show for any engine operating with a given cycle time that minimum total entropy production is achieved in a heat engine by operating it so as to keep the entropy production rate constant along each branch. For the limit of slow engine operation, the entropy production rate should be the same constant for all branches of the cycle. We obtain an expression for the minimum total entropy production and use this to give a bound on the maximum work which can be produced by such engines. This bound is significantly more realistic than the reversible one. Analogous results are derived for a working fluid which carries arbitrary flows from one potential to another.},

	abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) models provide a computationally efficient method for rapidly investigating the long time- and length-scale processes that play a critical role in many important biological and soft matter processes. Recently, Izvekov and Voth introduced a new multiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) method [J. Phys. Chem. B 109, 2469 (2005); J. Chem. Phys. 123, 134105 (2005)] for determining the effective interactions between CG sites using information from simulations of atomically detailed models. The present work develops a formal statistical mechanical framework for the MS-CG method and demonstrates that the variational principle underlying the method may, in principle, be employed to determine the many-body potential of mean force (PMF) that governs the equilibrium distribution of positions of the CG sites for the MS-CG models. A CG model that employs such a PMF as a “potential energy function” will generate an equilibrium probability distribution of CG sites that is consistent with the atomically detailed model from which the PMF is derived. Consequently, the MS-CG method provides a formal multiscale bridge rigorously connecting the equilibrium ensembles generated with atomistic and CG models. The variational principle also suggests a class of practical algorithms for calculating approximations to this many-body PMF that are optimal. These algorithms use computer simulation data from the atomically detailed model. Finally, important generalizations of the MS-CG method are introduced for treating systems with rigid intramolecular constraints and for developing CG models whose equilibrium momentum distribution is consistent with that of an atomically detailed model.},

While recent studies identifying collective variables with variational autoencoders (VAEs) have focused on the encoding and latent space discovered by a VAE, the impact of the decoding and its ability to act as a generative model remains unexplored. We demonstrate how VAEs may be used to learn (on-the-fly and with minimal human intervention) highly efficient, collective Monte Carlo moves that accelerate sampling along the learned collective variable. In contrast to many machine learning-based efforts to bias sampling and generate novel configurations, our methods result in exact sampling in the ensemble of interest and do not require reweighting. In fact, we show that the acceptance rates of our moves approach unity for a perfect VAE model. While this is never observed in practice, VAE-based Monte Carlo moves still enhance sampling of new configurations. We demonstrate, however, that the form of the encoding and decoding distributions, in particular the extent to which the decoder reflects the underlying physics, greatly impacts the performance of the trained VAE.},

Examples include the lamellipodia of spreading and migrating embryonic cells, and the bacterium Listeria monocytogenes, that propels itself through its host's cytoplasm by constructing behind it a polymerized tail of cross-linked actin filaments. Peskin et al. (1993) formulated a model to explain how a polymerizing filament could rectify the Brownian motion of an object so as to produce unidirectional force (Peskin, C., G. Odell, and G. Oster. 1993. Cellular motions and thermal fluctuations: the Brownian ratchet. Biophys. J. 65:316–324). Their "Brownian ratchet" model assumed that the filament was stiff and that thermal fluctuations affected only the "load," i.e., the object being pushed. However, under many conditions of biological interest, the thermal fluctuations of the load are insufficient to produce the observed motions. Here we shall show that the thermal motions of the polymerizing filaments can produce a directed force. This "elastic Brownian ratchet" can explain quantitatively the propulsion of Listeria and the protrusive mechanics of lamellipodia. The model also explains how the polymerization process nucleates the orthogonal structure of the actin network in lamellipodia.},

The projected dynamics can be realised in practice by introducing constraints, and it is shown that the Green–Kubo formulae computed with these dynamics do not suffer from the plateau problem.

            Classical thermodynamics was developed to help design the best protocols for operating heat engines that remain close to equilibrium at all times. Modern experimental techniques for manipulating microscopic and mesoscopic systems routinely access far-from-equilibrium states, demanding new theoretical tools to describe the optimal protocols in this more complicated regime. Prior studies have sought, in simple models, the protocol that minimizes dissipation. We use computational tools to investigate the diversity of low-dissipation protocols. We show that optimal protocols can be accompanied by a vast set of near-optimal protocols, which still offer the substantive benefits of the optimal protocol. Although solving for the optimal protocol is typically difficult, computationally identifying a near-optimal protocol can be comparatively easy.
          , 
            The development of sophisticated experimental means to control nanoscale systems has motivated efforts to design driving protocols that minimize the energy dissipated to the environment. Computational models are a crucial tool in this practical challenge. We describe a general method for sampling an ensemble of finite-time, nonequilibrium protocols biased toward a low average dissipation. We show that this scheme can be carried out very efficiently in several limiting cases. As an application, we sample the ensemble of low-dissipation protocols that invert the magnetization of a 2D Ising model and explore how the diversity of the protocols varies in response to constraints on the average dissipation. In this example, we find that there is a large set of protocols with average dissipation close to the optimal value, which we argue is a general phenomenon.},

	abstract = {The dissociation of a water molecule in liquid water is the fundamental event in acid-base chemistry, determining the pH of water. Because of the short time scales and microscopic length scales involved, the dynamics of this autoionization have not been directly probed by experiment. Here, the autoionization mechanism is revealed by sampling and analyzing ab initio molecular dynamics trajectories. We identify the rare fluctuations in solvation energies that destabilize an oxygen-hydrogen bond. Through the transfer of protons along a hydrogen bond “wire,” the nascent ions separate by three or more neighbors. If the hydrogen bond wire connecting the two ions is subsequently broken, a metastable charge-separated state is visited. The ions may then diffuse to large separations. If, however, the hydrogen bond wire remains unbroken, the ions recombine rapidly. Because of their concomitant large electric fields, the transient ionic species produced in this case may provide an experimentally detectable signal of the dynamics we report.},

We use the simulation to predict the viscoelastic scaling behavior of cross-linked actin networks, characterize the trajectories of actin in a myosin motility assay, and develop order parameters to measure contractility of a simulated actin network.

	abstract = {Mechanisms of kinetically driven nanocrystal shape transformations were elucidated by monitoring single particle etching of gold nanocrystals using in situ graphene liquid cell transmission electron microscopy (TEM). By systematically changing the chemical potential of the oxidative etching and then quantifying the facets of the nanocrystals, nonequilibrium processes of atom removal could be deduced. Etching at suﬃciently high oxidation potentials, both cube and rhombic dodecahedra (RDD)-shaped gold nanocrystals transform into kinetically stable tetrahexahedra (THH)-shaped particles. Whereas \{100\}-faceted cubes adopt an \{hk0\}-faceted THH intermediate where h/k depends on chemical potential, \{110\}-faceted RDD adopt a \{210\}-faceted THH intermediate regardless of driving force. For cube reactions, Monte Carlo simulations show that removing 6-coordinate edge atoms immediately reveals 7-coordinate interior atoms. The rate at which these 6- and 7-coordinate atoms are etched is sensitive to the chemical potential, resulting in diﬀerent THH facet structures with varying driving force. Conversely, when RDD are etched to THH, removal of 6-coordinate edge atoms reveals 6-coordinate interior atoms. Thus, changing the driving force for oxidation does not change the probability of edge atom versus interior atom removal, leading to a negligible eﬀect on the kinetically stabilized intermediate shape. These fundamental insights, facilitated by single-particle liquid-phase TEM imaging, provide important atomic-scale mechanistic details regarding the role of kinetics and chemical driving force in dictating shape transformations at the nanometer length scale.},

As was shown by Jarzynski and others, nonequilibrium forcing can theoretically be used to obtain equilibrium rare event statistics. The advantage seems to be that the external force can speed up the sampling of the rare events by biasing the equilibrium distribution towards a distribution under which the rare events are no longer rare. Yet algorithmic methods based on Jarzynski’s and related results often fail to be efficient because they are based on sampling in path space. We present a new method that replaces the path sampling problem by minimization of a cross-entropy-like functional which boils down to finding the optimal nonequilibrium forcing. We show how to solve the related optimization problem in an efficient way by using an iterative strategy based on milestoning.},

	abstract = {Self-assembly is a ubiquitous process in synthetic and biological systems, broadly defined as the spontaneous organization of multiple subunits (macromolecules, particles, etc.) into ordered multiunit structures. The vast majority of equilibrium assembly processes give rise to two states: one consisting of dispersed disassociated subunits and the other consisting of a bulk-condensed state of unlimited size. This review focuses on the more specialized class of self-limiting assembly, which describes equilibrium assembly processes resulting in finite-size structures. These systems pose a generic and basic question, how do thermodynamic processes involving noncovalent interactions between identical subunits “measure” and select the size of assembled structures? This review begins with an introduction to the basic statistical mechanical framework for assembly thermodynamics that is used to highlight the key physical ingredients ensuring that equilibrium assembly will terminate at finite dimensions. Then examples of self-limiting assembly systems are introduced, and they are classified within this framework based on two broad categories: self-closing assemblies and open-boundary assemblies. These include well-known cases in biology and synthetic soft matter (micellization of amphiphiles and shell and tubule formation of tapered subunits) as well as less widely known classes of assemblies, such as short-range attractive or long-range repulsive systems and geometrically frustrated assemblies. For each of these self-limiting mechanisms, the physical mechanisms that select equilibrium assembly size, as well as the potential limitations of finite-size selection, are described. Finally, alternative mechanisms for finite-size assemblies are discussed, and contrasts are drawn with the size control that these can achieve relative to self-limitation in equilibrium, single-species assemblies.},

This model allows us to generate new molecules for efficient exploration and optimization through open-ended spaces of chemical compounds. A deep neural network was trained on hundreds of thousands of existing chemical structures to construct three coupled functions: an encoder, a decoder, and a predictor. The encoder converts the discrete representation of a molecule into a real-valued continuous vector, and the decoder converts these continuous vectors back to discrete molecular representations. The predictor estimates chemical properties from the latent continuous vector representation of the molecule. Continuous representations of molecules allow us to automatically generate novel chemical structures by performing simple operations in the latent space, such as decoding random vectors, perturbing known chemical structures, or interpolating between molecules. Continuous representations also allow the use of powerful gradient-based optimization to efficiently guide the search for optimized functional compounds.

	abstract = {Many Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques currently available rely on discrete-time reversible Markov processes whose transition kernels are variations of the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm. We explore and generalize an alternative scheme recently introduced in the physics literature (Peters and de With 2012) where the target distribution is explored using a continuous-time nonreversible piecewise-deterministic Markov process. In the Metropolis–Hastings algorithm, a trial move to a region of lower target density, equivalently of higher “energy,” than the current state can be rejected with positive probability. In this alternative approach, a particle moves along straight lines around the space and, when facing a high energy barrier, it is not rejected but its path is modified by bouncing against this barrier. By reformulating this algorithm using inhomogeneous Poisson processes, we exploit standard sampling techniques to simulate exactly this Markov process in a wide range of scenarios of interest. Additionally, when the target distribution is given by a product of factors dependent only on subsets of the state variables, such as the posterior distribution associated with a probabilistic graphical model, this method can be modified to take advantage of this structure by allowing computationally cheaper “local” bounces, which only involve the state variables associated with a factor, while the other state variables keep on evolving. In this context, by leveraging techniques from chemical kinetics, we propose several computationally efficient implementations. Experimentally, this new class of Markov chain Monte Carlo schemes compares favorably to state-of-the-art methods on various Bayesian inference tasks, including for high-dimensional models and large datasets.

To address this, we assembled branched actin networks in vitro from purified components and used simultaneous fluorescence and atomic force microscopy to quantify their molecular composition and material properties under various forces. Remarkably, mechanical loading of these self-assembling materials increases their density, power, and efficiency. Microscopically, increased density reflects increased filament number and altered geometry but no change in average length. Macroscopically, increased density enhances network stiffness and resistance to mechanical failure beyond those of isotropic actin networks. These effects endow branched actin networks with memory of their mechanical history that shapes their material properties and motor activity. This work reveals intrinsic force feedback mechanisms by which mechanical resistance makes self-assembling actin networks stiffer, stronger, and more powerful.},

	abstract = {Biological materials, such as the actin cytoskeleton, exhibit remarkable structural adaptability to various external stimuli by consuming different amounts of energy. In this Letter, we use methods from large deviation theory to identify a thermodynamic control principle for structural transitions in a model cytoskeletal network. Specifically, we demonstrate that biasing the dynamics with respect to the work done by nonequilibrium components effectively renormalizes the interaction strength between such components, which can eventually result in a morphological transition. Our work demonstrates how a thermodynamic quantity can be used to renormalize effective interactions, which in turn can tune structure in a predictable manner, suggesting a thermodynamic principle for the control of cytoskeletal structure and dynamics.},

In vitro experiments and coarse-grained simulations have shown that the actin crosslinking proteins α-actinin and fascin segregate into distinct domains in single actin bundles with a molecular size-dependent competition-based mechanism. Here, by encapsulating actin, α-actinin, and fascin in giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs), we show that physical confinement can cause these proteins to form much more complex structures, including rings and asters at GUV peripheries and centers; the prevalence of different structures depends on GUV size. Strikingly, we found that α-actinin and fascin self-sort into separate domains in the aster structures with actin bundles whose apparent stiffness depends on the ratio of the relative concentrations of α-actinin and fascin. The observed boundary-imposed effect on protein sorting may be a general mechanism for creating emergent structures in biopolymer networks with multiple crosslinkers.},

Arp2/3 complex is active at the leading edge of motile cells, where it produces branches on the sides of existing filaments. Growth of these filaments produces force to protrude the membrane. Crystal structures, reconstructions from electron micrographs, and biophysical experiments have started to map out the steps through which proteins called nucleation-promoting factors stimulate the formation of branches. Formins nucleate and support the elongation of unbranched actin filaments for cytokinesis and various types of actin filament bundles.

The presence of linkers in the solution modifies the effective interrod interaction and can lead to interfilament attraction. Depending on the composition and physical properties of the system, such as linker-binding energies, filaments will orient either perpendicular or parallel to each other, leading to network-like or bundled structures. We show that such a system can have one of three generic phase diagrams, one dominated by bundles, another by networks, and the third containing both bundle and network-like phases. The first two diagrams can be found over a wide range of interaction energies, whereas the third diagram occurs only for a narrow range. These results provide theoretical understanding of the classification of linker proteins as bundling proteins or crosslinking proteins. In addition, they suggest possible mechanisms by which the cell may control cytoskeletal morphology.},

Here, we will review recent progress in our molecular understanding of the core biochemical machinery driving branched actin nucleation, from the generation of filament primers to Arp2/3 activator recruitment, regulation and turnover. Due to the wealth of information on distinct, Arp2/3 network-containing structures, we are largely focusing—in an exemplary fashion—on canonical lamellipodia of mesenchymal cells, which are regulated by Rac GTPases, their downstream effector WAVE Regulatory Complex and its target Arp2/3 complex. Novel insight additionally confirms that WAVE and Arp2/3 complexes regulate or are themselves tuned by additional prominent actin regulatory factors, including Ena/VASP family members and heterodimeric capping protein. Finally, we are considering recent insights into effects exerted by mechanical force, both at the branched network and individual actin regulator level.},

These structures and the comprising actin filaments must be mechanically stable to sustain these forces and maintain their structural integrity. Filaments in these dynamic structures must also be disassembled to recycle and replenish the pool of actin monomers available for polymerization. Actin-severing proteins such as cofilin and contractile myosin motor proteins fragment these nominally stable structures. We developed a mesoscopic-length-scale actin filament model to investigate force-induced filament fragmentation. We show that fragmentation in our model occurs at curvatures similar to previous measurements of fragmentation within (cofil)actin and actin-cofilactin boundaries. Boundaries between bare and cofilin-decorated segments are brittle and fragment at small bending and twisting deformations. Extending filaments disperses strain uniformly over subunit interfaces, and filaments fragment with no detectable partial rupture or plastic deformation. In contrast, bending or twisting filaments imposes nonuniform interface strain and leads to partial interface rupture, accelerating filament fragmentation. As a result, the rupture force under compressive loads is an order of magnitude lower than under tensile loads. Partial interface rupture may be a primary mechanism of accelerating actin filament fragmentation by other actin-destabilizing proteins.},

Rev. 78: 763–781, 1998. — The three-dimensional intracellular network formed by the filamentous polymers comprising the cytoskeletal affects the way cells sense their extracellular environment and respond to stimuli. Because the cytoskeleton is viscoelastic, it provides a continuous mechanical coupling throughout the cell that changes as the cytoskeleton remodels. Such mechanical effects, based on network formation, can influence ion channel activity at the plasma membrane of cells and may conduct mechanical stresses from the cell membrane to internal organelles. As a result, both rapid responses such as changes in intracellular Ca2+ and slower responses such as gene transcription or the onset of apoptosis can be elicited or modulated by mechanical perturbations. In addition to mechanical features, the cytoskeleton also provides a large negatively charged surface on which many signaling molecules including protein and lipid kinases, phospholipases, and GTPases localize in response to activation of specific transmembrane receptors. The resulting spatial localization and concomitant change in enzymatic activity can alter the magnitude and limit the range of intracellular signaling events.},

	abstract = {Significance
            We show that removal of a small number of bonds in a random elastic network can dramatically change its mechanical response. Our theoretical approach precisely and efficiently controls the local strain at one point in such a network in response to a strain applied elsewhere in the system. The responses we create are inspired by the long-range-correlated deformations that often characterize allostery in proteins. The ubiquity of allostery in biological molecules suggests that it is relatively easy to develop through evolution. Our nearly 100\% success rate in designing these responses by removing a very small fraction of bonds shows that it is similarly easy to create these types of elastic responses in disordered mechanical networks.
          , 
            Recent advances in designing metamaterials have demonstrated that global mechanical properties of disordered spring networks can be tuned by selectively modifying only a small subset of bonds. Here, using a computationally efficient approach, we extend this idea to tune more general properties of networks. With nearly complete success, we are able to produce a strain between any two target nodes in a network in response to an applied source strain on any other pair of nodes by removing only ∼1\% of the bonds. We are also able to control multiple pairs of target nodes, each with a different individual response, from a single source, and to tune multiple independent source/target responses simultaneously into a network. We have fabricated physical networks in macroscopic 2D and 3D systems that exhibit these responses. This work is inspired by the long-range coupled conformational changes that constitute allosteric function in proteins. The fact that allostery is a common means for regulation in biological molecules suggests that it is a relatively easy property to develop through evolution. In analogy, our results show that long-range coupled mechanical responses are similarly easy to achieve in disordered networks.},

Through this result, the concepts of polar factorization of real matrices, Helmholtz decomposition of vector fields, and nondecreasing rearrangements of real-valued functions are unified.

In contrast, recurrent neural networks (RNNs) exhibit linear scaling in memory and computational requirements but struggle to match the same performance as Transformers due to limitations in parallelization and scalability. We propose a novel model architecture, Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV), that combines the efficient parallelizable training of Transformers with the efficient inference of RNNs. Our approach leverages a linear attention mechanism and allows us to formulate the model as either a Transformer or an RNN, which parallelizes computations during training and maintains constant computational and memory complexity during inference, leading to the first non-transformer architecture to be scaled to tens of billions of parameters. Our experiments reveal that RWKV performs on par with similarly sized Transformers, suggesting that future work can leverage this architecture to create more efficient models. This work presents a significant step towards reconciling the trade-offs between computational efficiency and model performance in sequence processing tasks.},

A new method is also introduced to try to ensure that the ensemble of “starting points” (for the trial trajectories) is properly sampled. The rate constant estimates for the C7eq⇒C5 transition of alanine dipeptide in vacuum were used to demonstrate the consistency between Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. FFS-MD simulations were then performed for the study of the β2/αR⇒C5/C7eq transition in explicit solvent. The kinetic results for both systems in vacuum and explicit solvent are in general agreement with previous experimental and computational studies for this peptide. In vacuum, an additional dihedral angle besides the one typically used as order parameter is identified as a significant variable in the reaction coordinate model. In solution, several dihedral angles and variables that describe the solvent action on the molecule’s dynamics are found to play a significant role in the description of the system’s dynamics.},

	abstract = {Coarse-graining (CG) accelerates molecular simulations of protein dynamics by simulating sets of atoms as singular beads. Backmapping is the opposite operation of bringing lost atomistic details back from the CG representation. While machine learning (ML) has produced accurate and efficient CG simulations of proteins, fast and reliable backmapping remains a challenge. Rule-based methods produce poor all-atom geometries, needing computationally costly refinement through additional simulations. Recently proposed ML approaches outperform traditional baselines but are not transferable between proteins and sometimes generate unphysical atom placements with steric clashes and implausible torsion angles. This work addresses both issues to build a fast, transferable, and reliable generative backmapping tool for CG protein representations. We achieve generalization and reliability through a combined set of innovations: representation based on internal coordinates; an equivariant encoder/prior; a custom loss function that helps ensure local structure, global structure, and physical constraints; and expert curation of high-quality out-of-equilibrium protein data for training. Our results pave the way for out-of-the-box backmapping of coarse-grained simulations for arbitrary proteins.},

By combining an ergodic-sampling algorithm with the so-called “geometrical route”, which introduces a series of geometrical restraints as a preamble to the physical separation of the two partners, we achieve accurate binding free energy calculations for medium-sized protein–protein complexes within the microsecond timescale. The ergodic-sampling algorithm, namely, Gaussian-accelerated molecular dynamics (GaMD), implicitly helps explore the conformational change of the two binding partners as they associate reversibly by raising the energy wells. Therefore, independent simulations capturing the isomerization of proteins are no longer needed, reducing both the computational cost and human effort. Numerical applications indicate errors on the order of 0.1 kcal/mol for the Abl-SH3 domain binding a decapeptide, of 2.6 kcal/mol for the barnase–barstar complex, and of 0.2 kcal/mol for human leukocyte elastase binding the third domain of the turkey ovomucoid inhibitor. Compared with the classical geometrical route, which resorts to collective variables to describe the isomerization of proteins, our new strategy possesses remarkable convergence properties and robustness for protein–protein complexes owing to improved ergodic sampling. We are confident that the strategy presented in this study will have a broad range of applications, helping us understand recognition–association phenomena in the areas of physical, biological, and medicinal chemistry.},

Importance-sampling schemes represent an appealing option to accelerate the underlying dynamics by smoothing out the relevant free-energy barriers, but require the definition of suitable reaction-coordinate (RC) models expressed in terms of compact low-dimensional sets of collective variables (CVs). While most computational studies of slow molecular processes have traditionally relied on educated guesses based on human intuition to reduce the dimensionality of the problem at hand, a variety of machine-learning (ML) algorithms have recently emerged as powerful alternatives to discover meaningful CVs capable of capturing the dynamics of the slowest degrees of freedom. Considering a simple paradigmatic situation in which the long-time dynamics is dominated by the transition between two known metastable states, we compare two variational data-driven ML methods based on Siamese neural networks aimed at discovering a meaningful RC model─the slowest decorrelating CV of the molecular process, and the committor probability to first reach one of the two metastable states. One method is the state-free reversible variational approach for Markov processes networks (VAMPnets), or SRVs─the other, inspired by the transition path theory framework, is the variational committor-based neural networks, or VCNs. The relationship and the ability of these methodologies to discover the relevant descriptors of the slow molecular process of interest are illustrated with a series of simple model systems. We also show that both strategies are amenable to importance-sampling schemes through an appropriate reweighting algorithm that approximates the kinetic properties of the transition.},

	abstract = {In this paper we revisit the derivation of equations of motion for coarse-grained (CG) particles from the microscopic Hamiltonian dynamics of the underlying atomistic system in equilibrium. The derivation is based on the projection operator method and time-convolution equation. We demonstrate that due to the energy exchange between CG and intraparticle phase space coordinates in the microscopic system, the choice of projection operator is not unique, leading to different CG equations of motion that have the form of the nonlinear generalized Langevin equation (GLE). We derive the idempotence properties for the projection operators along the system trajectories and show that these properties result in streaming terms of the respective GLEs that are conservative forces and allow the expression of the non-conservative forces explicitly through thermodynamic averages, which can be measured from the microscopic simulations. The difference between GLEs that are presented herein lies in how the non-conservative forces are partitioned into dissipative and projected contributions. We compute the projected force and analyze conditions under which the projected (stochastic) force is orthogonal to (uncorrelated with) the momenta of CG particles, therefore justifying a transition to a framework of stochastic differential equations. We show that a position- and momentum-independent memory function appears only if the projected force is fully decoupled from the past CG positions and momenta, respectively. In the case of non-vanishing correlations between the projected force and the CG coordinates in past times, we derive explicitly the position- and momentum-dependent memory function in a form of projection onto a space spanned by N-order Hermite polynomials. The expressions presented herein can be used to construct a hierarchy of thermodynamically consistent CG models with momentum-dependent memory functions. They can also be used to design computational schemes for obtaining the parameters for GLEs and their variants such as dissipative particle dynamics equations from the microscopic data. We illustrate these applications by presenting the GLE with a memory function that is quadratic in the particle momenta.},

The reviewed literature shows that different social factors affect the two major components of STEM education attainment: (a) attainment of education in general, and (b) attainment of STEM education relative to non-STEM education conditional on educational attainment. Cognitive and social-psychological characteristics matter for both components, as do structural inﬂuences at the family, neighborhood, school, and broader cultural levels. However, whereas commonly used measures of socioeconomic status (SES) predict the attainment of general education, social-psychological factors are more important inﬂuences on participation and achievement in STEM versus non-STEM education. Domestically, disparities by family SES, race, and gender persist in STEM education. Internationally, American students lag behind those in some countries with fewer economic resources. Explanations for group disparities within the United States and the mediocre international ranking of US student performance require more research, a task that is best accomplished through interdisciplinary approaches.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we study the statistical limits of deep learning techniques for solving elliptic partial diﬀerential equations (PDEs) from random samples using the Deep Ritz Method (DRM) and PhysicsInformed Neural Networks (PINNs). To simplify the problem, we focus on a prototype elliptic PDE: the Schrödinger equation on a hypercube with zero Dirichlet boundary condition, which is applied in quantum-mechanical systems. We establish upper and lower bounds for both methods, which improve upon concurrently developed upper bounds for this problem via a fast rate generalization bound. We discover that the current Deep Ritz Method is sub-optimal and propose a modiﬁed version of it. We also prove that PINN and the modiﬁed version of DRM can achieve minimax optimal bounds over Sobolev spaces. Empirically, following recent work which has shown that the deep model accuracy will improve with growing training sets according to a power law, we supply computational experiments to show similar-behavior of dimension dependent power law for deep PDE solvers.},

	abstract = {The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a promising candidate for quantum applications on near-term Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computers. Despite a lot of empirical studies and recent progress in theoretical understanding of VQE’s optimization landscape, the convergence for optimizing VQE is far less understood. We provide the ﬁrst rigorous analysis of the convergence of VQEs in the over-parameterization regime. By connecting the training dynamics with the Riemannian Gradient Flow on the unit-sphere, we establish a threshold on the suﬃcient number of parameters for eﬃcient convergence, which depends polynomially on the system dimension and the spectral ratio, a property of the problem Hamiltonian, and could be resilient to gradient noise to some extent. We further illustrate that this over-parameterization threshold could be vastly reduced for speciﬁc VQE instances by establishing an ansatz-dependent threshold paralleling our main result. We showcase that our ansatz-dependent threshold could serve as a proxy of the trainability of diﬀerent VQE ansatzes without performing empirical experiments, which hence leads to a principled way of evaluating ansatz design. Finally, we conclude with a comprehensive empirical study that supports our theoretical ﬁndings.},

(1) A Sobolev space-trained, convolutional neural network is employed to handle the exponential dimension increase of the discretized, local average monomer density fields and to strongly enforce both spatial translation and rotation invariance of the predicted, field-theoretic intensive Hamiltonian. (2) A generative adversarial network (GAN) is introduced to efficiently and accurately predict saddle point, local average monomer density fields without resorting to gradient descent methods that employ the training set. This GAN approach yields important savings of both memory and computational cost. (3) The proposed machine learning framework is successfully applied to 2D cell size optimization as a clear illustration of its broad potential to accelerate the exploration of parameter space for discovering polymer nanostructures. Extensions to three-dimensional phase discovery appear to be feasible.},

	abstract = {Physical systems powering motion and creating structure in a fixed amount of time dissipate energy and produce entropy. Whether living, synthetic or engineered, systems performing these dynamic functions must balance dissipation and speed. Here, we show that rates of energy and entropy exchange are subject to a speed limit—a time–information uncertainty relation—imposed by the rates of change in the information content of the system. This uncertainty relation bounds the time that elapses before the change in a thermodynamic quantity has the same magnitude as its s.d. From this general bound, we establish a family of speed limits for heat, dissipated/chemical work and entropy depending on the experimental constraints on the system and its environment. In all of these inequalities, the timescale of transient dynamical fluctuations is universally bounded by the Fisher information. Moreover, they all have a mathematical form that mirrors the Mandelstam–Tamm version of the time–energy uncertainty relation in quantum mechanics. These bounds on the speed of arbitrary observables apply to transient systems away from thermodynamic equilibrium, independent of the physical constraints on the stochastic dynamics or their function.},

More recently, this historically theoretical pursuit has become relevant in practical situations where information is manipulated at small scales, such as in molecular and cell biology, artificial nano-devices or quantum computation.

	abstract = {Inspired by biology's most sophisticated computer, the brain, neural networks constitute a profound reformulation of computational principles. Remarkably, analogous high-dimensional, highly-interconnected computational architectures also arise within information-processing molecular systems inside living cells, such as signal transduction cascades and genetic regulatory networks. Might neuromorphic collective modes be found more broadly in other physical and chemical processes, even those that ostensibly play non-information-processing roles such as protein synthesis, metabolism, or structural self-assembly? Here we examine nucleation during self-assembly of multicomponent structures, showing that high-dimensional patterns of concentrations can be discriminated and classified in a manner similar to neural network computation. Specifically, we design a set of 917 DNA tiles that can self-assemble in three alternative ways such that competitive nucleation depends sensitively on the extent of co-localization of high-concentration tiles within the three structures. The system was trained in-silico to classify a set of 18 grayscale 30 x 30 pixel images into three categories. Experimentally, fluorescence and atomic force microscopy monitoring during and after a 150-hour anneal established that all trained images were correctly classified, while a test set of image variations probed the robustness of the results. While slow compared to prior biochemical neural networks, our approach is surprisingly compact, robust, and scalable. This success suggests that ubiquitous physical phenomena, such as nucleation, may hold powerful information processing capabilities when scaled up as high-dimensional multicomponent systems.},

	abstract = {Many biological systems rely on the ability to self-assemble different target structures using the same set of components. Equilibrium self-assembly suffers from a limited capacity in such cases, due to an increasing number of decoy states that grows rapidly with the number of targets encoded. Moreover, improving the kinetic stability of a target at equilibrium carries the price of introducing kinetic traps, leading to slower assembly. Using a toy physical model of interacting particles, we demonstrate that local driving can improve both the assembly time and kinetic stability of multitarget self-assembly, as well as reduce fluctuations around the target configuration. We further show that the local drive can result in a steady-state probability distribution over target structures that deviates from the Boltzmann distribution in a way that depends on the types of interactions that stabilize the targets. Our results illustrate the role that nonequilibrium driving plays in overcoming tradeoffs that are inherent to equilibrium assemblies.},

	abstract = {One of the most important properties of classical neural networks is how surprisingly trainable they are, though their training algorithms typically rely on optimizing complicated, nonconvex loss functions. Previous results have shown that unlike the case in classical neural networks, variational quantum models are often not trainable. The most studied phenomenon is the onset of barren plateaus in the training landscape of these quantum models, typically when the models are very deep. This focus on barren plateaus has made the phenomenon almost synonymous with the trainability of quantum models. Here, we show that barren plateaus are only a part of the story. We prove that a wide class of variational quantum models—which are shallow, and exhibit no barren plateaus—have only a superpolynomially small fraction of local minima within any constant energy from the global minimum, rendering these models untrainable if no good initial guess of the optimal parameters is known. We also study the trainability of variational quantum algorithms from a statistical query framework, and show that noisy optimization of a wide variety of quantum models is impossible with a sub-exponential number of queries. Finally, we numerically confirm our results on a variety of problem instances. Though we exclude a wide variety of quantum algorithms here, we give reason for optimism for certain classes of variational algorithms and discuss potential ways forward in showing the practical utility of such algorithms.},

	abstract = {Nanoparticle assembly and attachment are common pathways of crystal growth by which particles organize into larger scale materials with hierarchical structure and long-range order. In particular, oriented attachment (OA), which is a special type of particle assembly, has attracted great attention in recent years because of the wide range of material structures that result from this process, such as one-dimensional (1D) nanowires, two-dimensional (2D) sheets, three-dimensional (3D) branched structures, twinned crystals, defects, etc. Utilizing in situ transmission electron microscopy techniques, researchers observed orientation-specific forces that act over short distances (∼1 nm) from the particle surfaces and drive the OA process. Integrating recently developed 3D fast force mapping via atomic force microscopy with theories and simulations, researchers have resolved the near-surface solution structure, the molecular details of charge states at particle/fluid interfaces, inhomogeneity of surface charges, and dielectric/magnetic properties of particles that influence short- and long-range forces, such as electrostatic, van der Waals, hydration, and dipole–dipole forces. In this review, we discuss the fundamental principles for understanding particle assembly and attachment processes, and the controlling factors and resulting structures. We review recent progress in the field via examples of both experiments and modeling, and discuss current developments and the future outlook.},

In this work, we demonstrate that appropriate assembly and processing conditions can also enable control over the microstructure of NCT lattices by balancing the enthalpic and entropic factors associated with ligand packing and supramolecular bonding during crystallization. Unary systems of NCTs are assembled via the addition of a small molecule capable of binding to multiple nanoparticle ligands; these NCTs initially form face-centered-cubic (FCC) structures in solvents that are favorable for the particles’ polymer brushes. However, the FCC lattices undergo a reversible, diffusionless phase transition to body-centered-cubic (BCC) lattices when transferred to a solvent that induces polymer brush collapse. The BCC superlattices maintain the same crystal habit as the parent FCC phase but exhibit significant transformation twinning similar to that seen in martensitic alloys. This previously unseen diffusionless phase transformation in NPSLs enables unique microstructural features in the resulting assemblies, suggesting that NPSLs could serve as models for the investigation of microstructural evolution in crystalline systems and extend our understanding of NPSLs as atomic material analogues.},

This Review surveys rotary devices and systems in which such forces control small-scale flows, self-organization phenomena, materials synthesis or chemical reactivity at molecular and macromolecular levels. Centrifugal forces directed away from the rotation axis enable various separations or lab-on-a-disc systems and can shape interfaces or deposit thin films of functional materials. When these forces act on particles lighter than the rotating fluid, they can provide the basis for colloidal crystallization or trapping; when the direction of rotation changes, they can simulate microgravity conditions and affect motility patterns of living organisms. Shear forces, by contrast, can promote crystallization, couple to molecular-scale assembly and affect its chiral outcomes. Combining centrifugal and shear forces is useful in establishing rotating reactors to accelerate reaction kinetics, modulate chemical reactivity, enable multistep syntheses or support complex extractions. Through these and other examples, we illustrate that rotating reaction vessels can enable new types of chemical experimentation, with outcomes that are not always understood. We argue that rotating systems for studying such processes will become more common given advances in remotely controlled sensors and spectrometers that can monitor the contents of rotating vessels.},

Here we use a geometric deep-learning framework operating on protein surfaces that generates fingerprints to describe geometric and chemical features that are critical to drive protein–protein interactions10. We hypothesized that these fingerprints capture the key aspects of molecular recognition that represent a new paradigm in the computational design of novel protein interactions. As a proof of principle, we computationally designed several de novo protein binders to engage four protein targets: SARS-CoV-2 spike, PD-1, PD-L1 and CTLA-4. Several designs were experimentally optimized, whereas others were generated purely in silico, reaching nanomolar affinity with structural and mutational characterization showing highly accurate predictions. Overall, our surface-centric approach captures the physical and chemical determinants of molecular recognition, enabling an approach for the de novo design of protein interactions and, more broadly, of artificial proteins with function.},

	abstract = {We present rectiﬁed ﬂow, a surprisingly simple approach to learning (neural) ordinary differential equation (ODE) models to transport between two empirically observed distributions π0 and π1, hence providing a uniﬁed solution to generative modeling and domain transfer, among various other tasks involving distribution transport. The idea of rectiﬁed ﬂow is to learn the ODE to follow the straight paths connecting the points drawn from π0 and π1 as much as possible. This is achieved by solving a straightforward nonlinear least squares optimization problem, which can be easily scaled to large models without introducing extra parameters beyond standard supervised learning. The straight paths are special and preferred because they are the shortest paths between two points, and can be simulated exactly without time discretization and hence yield computationally efﬁcient models. We show that the procedure of learning a rectiﬁed ﬂow from data, called rectiﬁcation, turns an arbitrary coupling of π0 and π1 to a new deterministic coupling with provably non-increasing convex transport costs. In addition, recursively applying rectiﬁcation allows us to obtain a sequence of ﬂows with increasingly straight paths, which can be simulated accurately with coarse time discretization in the inference phase. In empirical studies, we show that rectiﬁed ﬂow performs superbly on image generation, image-to-image translation, and domain adaptation. In particular, on image generation and translation, our method yields nearly straight ﬂows that give high quality results even with a single Euler discretization step.},

	abstract = {Solving transport problems, i.e. ﬁnding a map transporting one given distribution to another, has numerous applications in machine learning. Novel mass transport methods motivated by generative modeling have recently been proposed, e.g. Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) and Flow Matching Models (FMMs) implement such a transport through a Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) or an Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE). However, while it is desirable in many applications to approximate the deterministic dynamic Optimal Transport (OT) map which admits attractive properties, DDMs and FMMs are not guaranteed to provide transports close to the OT map. In contrast, Schrödinger bridges (SBs) compute stochastic dynamic mappings which recover entropy-regularized versions of OT. Unfortunately, existing numerical methods approximating SBs either scale poorly with dimension or accumulate errors across iterations. In this work, we introduce Iterative Markovian Fitting, a new methodology for solving SB problems, and Diffusion Schrödinger Bridge Matching (DSBM), a novel numerical algorithm for computing IMF iterates. DSBM signiﬁcantly improves over previous SB numerics and recovers as special/limiting cases various recent transport methods. We demonstrate the performance of DSBM on a variety of problems.},

This CS polymer field theory has been largely overlooked during the intervening period in favor of more conventional “auxiliary field” (AF) interacting polymer representations that form the basis of modern self-consistent field theory (SCFT) and field-theoretic simulation approaches. Here we argue that the CS representation provides a simpler and computationally more efficient framework than the AF approach for broad classes of reversibly bonding polymers encountered in supramolecular polymer science. The CS formalism is reviewed, initially for a simple homopolymer solution, and then extended to supramolecular polymers capable of forming reversible linkages and networks. In the context of the Edwards model of a non-reacting homopolymer solution and one and two-component models of telechelic reacting polymers, we discuss the structure of CS mean-field theory, including the equivalence to SCFT, and show how weak-amplitude expansions (random phase approximations) can be readily developed without explicit enumeration of all reaction products in a mixture. We further illustrate how to analyze CS field theories beyond SCFT at the level of Gaussian field fluctuations and provide a perspective on direct numerical simulations using a recently developed complex Langevin technique.},

            This monograph provides an introduction to field-theoretic simulations in classical soft matter, including polymers, and Bose quantum fluids. The method represents a new class of molecular simulation in which continuous fields are sampled and evolved, rather than particle coordinates. Field-theoretic simulations are computationally advantaged over particle methods for dense phases of high molecular weight polymers and can reach length scales of microns or more. The monograph details analytical methods for converting classical and quantum many-body problems to equilibrium field theory models with a molecular basis. Numerical methods are described that enable efficient, accurate, and scalable simulations of such models on modern computer hardware, including graphics processing units (GPUs). Extensions to non-equilibrium systems are discussed, along with an introduction to advanced field-theoretic simulation techniques including free energy estimation, alternative ensembles, coarse-graining, and variable cell methods.},

While our benchmark study is somewhat limited, we make recommendations for the use of ph-AFQMC for general main-group chemistry applications. For systems where single determinant wave functions are qualitatively accurate, we expect the accuracy of ph-AFQMC in conjunction with a single determinant trial wave function to be between that of coupled-cluster with singles and doubles (CCSD) and CCSD with perturbative triples (CCSD(T)). For these applications, ph-AFQMC should be a method of choice when canonical CCSD(T) is too expensive to run. For systems where multi-reference (MR) wave functions are needed for qualitative accuracy, ph-AFQMC is far more accurate than MR perturbation theory methods and competitive with MR configuration interaction (MRCI) methods. Due to the computational efficiency of ph-AFQMC compared to MRCI, we recommended ph-AFQMC as a method of choice for handling dynamic correlation in MR problems. We conclude with a discussion of important directions for future development of the ph-AFQMC approach.},

This work shows that when reduced in size and DNA grafting density, PAEs behave as electron equivalents (EEs), roaming through and stabilizing the lattices defined by larger PAEs, as electrons do in metals in the classical picture. This discovery defines a new property of colloidal crystals—metallicity—that is characterized by the extent of EE delocalization and diffusion. As the number of strands increases or the temperature decreases, the EEs localize, which is structurally reminiscent of a metal-insulator transition. Colloidal crystal metallicity, therefore, provides new routes to metallic, intermetallic, and compound phases.},

Recently, the range of accessible inorganic cores and tunable surface chemistries dramatically increased, expanding the set of nanocrystal arrangements experimentally attainable. In this review, we discuss efforts to create next-generation materials via bottom-up organization of nanocrystals with preprogrammed functionality and self-assembly instructions. This process is often driven by both interparticle interactions and the influence of the assembly environment. The introduction provides the reader with a practical overview of nanocrystal synthesis, self-assembly, and superlattice characterization. We then summarize the theory of nanocrystal interactions and examine fundamental principles governing nanocrystal self-assembly from hard and soft particle perspectives borrowed from the comparatively established fields of micrometer colloids and block copolymer assembly. We outline the extensive catalog of superlattices prepared to date using hydrocarbon-capped nanocrystals with spherical, polyhedral, rod, plate, and branched inorganic core shapes, as well as those obtained by mixing combinations thereof. We also provide an overview of structural defects in nanocrystal superlattices. We then explore the unique possibilities offered by leveraging nontraditional surface chemistries and assembly environments to control superlattice structure and produce nonbulk assemblies. We end with a discussion of the unique optical, magnetic, electronic, and catalytic properties of ordered nanocrystal superlattices, and the coming advances required to make use of this new class of solids.},

To accomplish this while avoiding immobilization by sialic acid in host mucus, viruses rely on a balance between the receptor-binding protein hemagglutinin (HA) and the receptor-cleaving protein neuraminidase (NA). Although genetic aspects of this balance are well-characterized, little is known about how the spatial organization of these proteins in the viral envelope may contribute. Using site-specific fluorescent labeling and super-resolution microscopy, we show that HA and NA are asymmetrically distributed on the surface of filamentous viruses, creating a spatial organization of binding and cleaving activities that causes viruses to step consistently away from their NA-rich pole. This Brownian ratchet-like diffusion produces persistent directional mobility that resolves the virus’s conflicting needs to both penetrate mucus and stably attach to the underlying cells, potentially contributing to the prevalence of the filamentous phenotype in clinical isolates of IAV.},

The resulting transport is exact by construction, allows for greater flexibility in choosing the dynamics of the underlying diffusion, and can be approximated by means of a neural network via novel training objectives. We develop an unifying view of the drift adjustments corresponding to our and to time-reversal approaches and make use of this representation to inspect the inner workings of diffusion-based generative models.

We perform an initial theoretical investigation of the IDBM procedure, establishing its convergence properties. The theoretical findings are complemented by numerous numerical experiments illustrating the competitive performance of the IDBM procedure across various applications. Recent advancements in generative modeling employ the time-reversal of a diffusion process to define a generative process that approximately transports a simple distribution to the data distribution. As an alternative, we propose using the first iteration of the IDBM procedure as an approximation-free method for realizing this transport. This approach offers greater flexibility in selecting the generative process dynamics and exhibits faster training and superior sample quality over longer discretization intervals. In terms of implementation, the necessary modifications are minimally intrusive, being limited to the training loss computation, with no changes necessary for generative sampling.},

By viewing diffusion models as latent variable models with unobserved diffusion trajectories and applying maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) with latent trajectories imputed from an auxiliary distribution, we show that both the model construction and the imputation of latent trajectories amount to constructing diffusion bridge processes that achieve deterministic values and constraints at end point, for which we provide a systematic study and a suit of tools. Leveraging our framework, we present 1) a ﬁrst theoretical error analysis for learning diffusion generation models, and 2) a simple and uniﬁed approach to learning on data from different discrete and constrained domains.

	abstract = {Branched actin networks are self-assembling molecular motors that move biological membranes and drive many important cellular processes, including phagocytosis, endocytosis, and pseudopod protrusion. When confronted with opposing forces, the growth rate of these networks slows and their density increases, but the stoichiometry of key components does not change. The molecular mechanisms governing this force response are not well understood, so we used single-molecule imaging and AFM cantilever deflection to measure how applied forces affect each step in branched actin network assembly. Although load forces are observed to increase the density of growing filaments, we find that they actually decrease the rate of filament nucleation due to inhibitory interactions between actin filament ends and nucleation promoting factors. The force-induced increase in network density turns out to result from an exponential drop in the rate constant that governs filament capping. The force dependence of filament capping matches that of filament elongation and can be explained by expanding Brownian Ratchet theory to cover both processes. We tested a key prediction of this expanded theory by measuring the force-dependent activity of engineered capping protein variants and found that increasing the size of the capping protein increases its sensitivity to applied forces. In summary, we find that Brownian Ratchets underlie not only the ability of growing actin filaments to generate force but also the ability of branched actin networks to adapt their architecture to changing loads.},

	abstract = {X-ray scattering is a structural characterization tool that has impacted diverse fields of study. It is unique in its ability to examine materials in real time and under realistic sample environments, enabling researchers to understand morphology at nanometer and angstrom length scales using complementary small and wide angle X-ray scattering (SAXS, WAXS), respectively. Herein, we focus on the use of SAXS to examine nanoscale particulate systems. We provide a theoretical foundation for X-ray scattering, considering both form factor and structure factor, as well as the use of correlation functions, which may be used to determine a particle’s size, size distribution, shape, and organization into hierarchical structures. The theory is expanded upon with contemporary use cases. Both transmission and reflection (grazing incidence) geometries are addressed, as well as the combination of SAXS with other X-ray and non-X-ray characterization tools. We conclude with an examination of several key areas of research where X-ray scattering has played a pivotal role, including in situ nanoparticle synthesis, nanoparticle assembly, and operando studies of catalysts and energy storage materials. Throughout this review we highlight the unique capabilities of X-ray scattering for structural characterization of materials in their native environment.},

	abstract = {Coarse-grained models are a core computational tool in theoretical chemistry and biophysics. A judicious choice of a coarse-grained model can yield physical insights by isolating the essential degrees of freedom that dictate the thermodynamic properties of a complex, condensed-phase system. The reduced complexity of the model typically leads to lower computational costs and more efficient sampling compared with atomistic models. Designing “good” coarse-grained models is an art. Generally, the mapping from fine-grained configurations to coarse-grained configurations itself is not optimized in any way; instead, the energy function associated with the mapped configurations is. In this work, we explore the consequences of optimizing the coarse-grained representation alongside its potential energy function. We use a graph machine learning framework to embed atomic configurations into a low-dimensional space to produce efficient representations of the original molecular system. Because the representation we obtain is no longer directly interpretable as a real-space representation of the atomic coordinates, we also introduce an inversion process and an associated thermodynamic consistency relation that allows us to rigorously sample fine-grained configurations conditioned on the coarse-grained sampling. We show that this technique is robust, recovering the first two moments of the distribution of several observables in proteins such as chignolin and alanine dipeptide.},

We propose here an elegant and simple solution to this issue, which consists of (i) detecting uncoupled groups of coupled trajectory basis functions and (ii) selecting stochastically one of these groups to continue the ab initio multiple spawning dynamics. We show that this procedure can reproduce the results of full ab initio multiple spawning dynamics in cases where the uncoupled groups of trajectory basis functions stay uncoupled throughout the dynamics (which is often the case in high-dimensional problems).

Parametrizing CG force fields to match all-atom simulations has mainly relied on force-matching or relative entropy minimization, which require many samples from costly simulations with all-atom or CG resolutions, respectively. Here we present flow-matching, a new training method for CG force fields that combines the advantages of both methods by leveraging normalizing flows, a generative deep learning method. Flow-matching first trains a normalizing flow to represent the CG probability density, which is equivalent to minimizing the relative entropy without requiring iterative CG simulations. Subsequently, the flow generates samples and forces according to the learned distribution in order to train the desired CG free energy model via force-matching. Even without requiring forces from the all-atom simulations, flow-matching outperforms classical force-matching by an order of magnitude in terms of data efficiency and produces CG models that can capture the folding and unfolding transitions of small proteins.},

	abstract = {We introduce a class of generative models based on the stochastic interpolant framework proposed in [1] that uniﬁes ﬂow-based and diﬀusion-based methods. We ﬁrst show how to construct a broad class of continuous-time stochastic processes whose time-dependent probability density function bridges two arbitrary densities exactly in ﬁnite time. These ‘stochastic interpolants’ are built by combining data from the two densities with an additional latent variable, and the speciﬁc details of the construction can be leveraged to shape the resulting time-dependent density in a ﬂexible way. We then show that the time-dependent density of the stochastic interpolant satisﬁes a ﬁrst-order transport equation as well as a family of forward and backward Fokker-Planck equations with tunable diﬀusion; upon consideration of the time evolution of an individual sample, this viewpoint immediately leads to both deterministic and stochastic generative models based on probability ﬂow equations or stochastic diﬀerential equations with a tunable level of noise. The drift coeﬃcients entering these models are time-dependent velocity ﬁelds characterized as the unique minimizers of simple quadratic objective functions, one of which is a new objective for the score of the interpolant density. Remarkably, we show that minimization of these quadratic objectives leads to control of the likelihood for generative models built upon stochastic dynamics; by contrast, we show that generative models based upon a deterministic dynamics must, in addition, control the Fisher divergence between the target and the model. Finally, we construct estimators for the likelihood and the cross-entropy of interpolant-based generative models, and demonstrate that such models recover the Schr¨odinger bridge between the two target densities when explicitly optimizing over the interpolant.},

            Dynamics and conformational sampling are essential for linking protein structure to biological function. While challenging to probe experimentally, computer simulations are widely used to describe protein dynamics, but at significant computational costs that continue to limit the systems that can be studied. Here, we demonstrate that machine learning can be trained with simulation data to directly generate physically realistic conformational ensembles of proteins without the need for any sampling and at negligible computational cost. As a proof-of-principle we train a generative adversarial network based on a transformer architecture with self-attention on coarse-grained simulations of intrinsically disordered peptides. The resulting model, idpGAN, can predict sequence-dependent coarse-grained ensembles for sequences that are not present in the training set demonstrating that transferability can be achieved beyond the limited training data. We also retrain idpGAN on atomistic simulation data to show that the approach can be extended in principle to higher-resolution conformational ensemble generation.},

Recent machine learning methods approached this problem using an atom-by-atom generation approach, which is computationally expensive. In this paper, we formulate SBDD as a 3D-conditional generation problem and present DiffSBDD, an E(3)-equivariant 3D-conditional diffusion model that generates novel ligands conditioned on protein pockets. Furthermore, we curate a new dataset of experimentally determined binding complex data from Binding MOAD to provide a realistic binding scenario that complements the synthetic CrossDocked dataset.

On larger molecules especially, the ground state energy can be improved by dozens of kcal/mol, a qualitative leap over previous methods.

The large deviations properties of general time-additive observables involving the position and the increments of the dynamical trajectory are then analyzed in terms of the appropriate Markov tilted processes and of the corresponding conditioned processes obtained via the generalization of Doob’s h-transform. This general formalism is described in detail for the three possible frameworks, namely discrete-time/discrete-space Markov chains, continuous-time/discrete-space Markov jump processes and continuous-time/continuous-space diffusion processes, and is illustrated with explicit results for the Sisyphus random walk and its variants, when the reset probabilities or reset rates are space-dependent.},

	abstract = {Controlling thermodynamic cycles to minimize the dissipated heat is a long-standing goal in thermodynamics, and more recently, a central challenge in stochastic thermodynamics for nanoscale systems. Here, we introduce a theoretical and computational framework for optimizing nonequilibrium control protocols that can transform a system between two distributions in a minimally dissipative fashion. These protocols optimally transport a system along paths through the space of probability distributions that minimize the dissipative cost of a transformation. Furthermore, we show that the thermodynamic metric—determined via a linear response approach—can be directly derived from the same objective function that is optimized in the optimal transport problem, thus providing a unified perspective on thermodynamic geometries. We investigate this unified geometric framework in two model systems and observe that our procedure for optimizing control protocols is robust beyond linear response.},

	abstract = {To address the large gap between time scales that can be easily reached by molecular simulations and those required to understand protein dynamics, we propose a rapid self-consistent approximation of the side chain free energy at every integration step. In analogy with the adiabatic Born-Oppenheimer approximation for electronic structure, the protein backbone dynamics are simulated as preceding according to the dictates of the free energy of an instantaneously-equilibrated side chain potential. The side chain free energy is computed on the fly, allowing the protein backbone dynamics to traverse a greatly smoothed energetic landscape. This results in extremely rapid equilibration and sampling of the Boltzmann distribution. Because our method employs a reduced model involving single-bead side chains, we also provide a novel, maximum-likelihood method to parameterize the side chain model using input data from high resolution protein crystal structures. We demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy for predicting \${\textbackslash}chi\_1\$ rotamer states while consuming only milliseconds of CPU time. We also show that the resulting free energies of side chains is sufficiently accurate for de novo folding of some proteins.},

Practitioners often achieve this by a variety of seemingly ad hoc procedures such as ﬁtting to the empirical measure generated by the data and ﬁtting to properties of autocorrelation functions. Statisticians, on the other hand, often use estimation procedures, which ﬁt diﬀusion processes to data by applying the maximum likelihood principle to the path-space density of the desired model equations, and through knowledge of the properties of quadratic variation. In this paper we show that the procedures used by practitioners and statisticians to ﬁt drift functions are, in fact, closely related and can be thought of as two alternative ways to regularize the (singular) likelihood function for the drift. We also present the results of numerical experiments which probe the relative eﬃcacy of the two approaches to model identiﬁcation and compare them with other methods such as the minimum distance estimator.},

It is based on the close relation between eigenpairs of the diffusion operator L and those of the conditional expectation operator Pt, a relation stemming from the semigroup structure Pt ¼ expðtLÞ for t ≥ 0. It allows for estimation without making time discretization errors, an aspect that is particularly advantageous in the case of data with low sampling frequency. After estimating eigenpairs of L via eigenpairs of Pt, we infer the drift and diffusion functions that determine L by fitting L to the estimated eigenpairs using a convex optimization procedure. We present numerical examples in which we apply the procedure to oneand two-dimensional diffusions, reversible as well as nonreversible. In the second part of the paper, we consider estimation of coarse-grained (homogenized) diffusion processes from multiscale data. We show that eigenpairs of the homogenized diffusion operator are asymptotically close to eigenpairs of the underlying multiscale diffusion operator. This implies that we can infer the correct homogenized process from data of the multiscale process, using the estimation procedure discussed in the first part of the paper. This is illustrated with numerical examples.},

The framework includes many well-studied structural constraints such as (generalized) additive models. While there is a lot of flexibility in the network architecture, the tuning parameter is the sparsity of the network. Specifically, we consider large networks with number of potential network parameters exceeding the sample size. The analysis gives some insights into why multilayer feedforward neural networks perform well in practice. Interestingly, for ReLU activation function the depth (number of layers) of the neural network architectures plays an important role, and our theory suggests that for nonparametric regression, scaling the network depth with the sample size is natural. It is also shown that under the composition assumption wavelet estimators can only achieve suboptimal rates.},

Condensates are often presumed to increase enzymatic reaction rates through increased concentrations of enzymes and substrates (mass action), although this idea has not been widely tested and other mechanisms of modulation are possible. Here we describe a synthetic system where the SUMOylation enzyme cascade is recruited into engineered condensates generated by liquid–liquid phase separation of multidomain scaffolding proteins. SUMOylation rates can be increased up to 36-fold in these droplets compared to the surrounding bulk, depending on substrate KM. This dependency produces substantial specificity among different substrates. Analyses of reactions above and below the phase-separation threshold lead to a quantitative model in which reactions in condensates are accelerated by mass action and changes in substrate KM, probaby due to scaffold-induced molecular organization. Thus, condensates can modulate reaction rates both by concentrating molecules and physically organizing them.},

            Quantum simulation of chemical systems is one of the most promising near-term applications of quantum computers. The variational quantum eigensolver, a leading algorithm for molecular simulations on quantum hardware, has a serious limitation in that it typically relies on a pre-selected wavefunction ansatz that results in approximate wavefunctions and energies. Here we present an arbitrarily accurate variational algorithm that, instead of fixing an ansatz upfront, grows it systematically one operator at a time in a way dictated by the molecule being simulated. This generates an ansatz with a small number of parameters, leading to shallow-depth circuits. We present numerical simulations, including for a prototypical strongly correlated molecule, which show that our algorithm performs much better than a unitary coupled cluster approach, in terms of both circuit depth and chemical accuracy. Our results highlight the potential of our adaptive algorithm for exact simulations with present-day and near-term quantum hardware.},

Accessing this potential has been challenging for computation and experiments because the space of possible protein molecules is much larger than the space of those likely to host function. Here we introduce Chroma, a generative model for proteins and protein complexes that can directly sample novel protein structures and sequences and that can be conditioned to steer the generative process towards desired properties and functions. To enable this, we introduce a diffusion process that respects the conformational statistics of polymer ensembles, an efﬁcient neural architecture for molecular systems based on random graph neural networks that enables long-range reasoning with sub-quadratic scaling, equivariant layers for efﬁciently synthesizing 3D structures of proteins from predicted inter-residue geometries, and a general low-temperature sampling algorithm for diffusion models. We suggest that Chroma can effectively realize protein design as Bayesian inference under external constraints, which can involve symmetries, substructure, shape, semantics, and even natural language prompts. With this uniﬁed approach, we hope to accelerate the prospect of programming protein matter for human health, materials science, and synthetic biology.},

	abstract = {Recent work in scientific machine learning has developed so-called physics-informed neural network (PINN) models. The typical approach is to incorporate physical domain knowledge as soft constraints on an empirical loss function and use existing machine learning methodologies to train the model. We demonstrate that, while existing PINN methodologies can learn good models for relatively trivial problems, they can easily fail to learn relevant physical phenomena for even slightly more complex problems. In particular, we analyze several distinct situations of widespread physical interest, including learning differential equations with convection, reaction, and diffusion operators. We provide evidence that the soft regularization in PINNs, which involves PDE-based differential operators, can introduce a number of subtle problems, including making the problem more ill-conditioned. Importantly, we show that these possible failure modes are not due to the lack of expressivity in the NN architecture, but that the PINN's setup makes the loss landscape very hard to optimize. We then describe two promising solutions to address these failure modes. The first approach is to use curriculum regularization, where the PINN's loss term starts from a simple PDE regularization, and becomes progressively more complex as the NN gets trained. The second approach is to pose the problem as a sequence-to-sequence learning task, rather than learning to predict the entire space-time at once. Extensive testing shows that we can achieve up to 1-2 orders of magnitude lower error with these methods as compared to regular PINN training.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we consider the density estimation problem associated with the stationary measure of ergodic Itô diffusions from a discrete-time series that approximate the solutions of the stochastic differential equations. To take an advantage of the characterization of density function through the stationary solution of a parabolic-type Fokker-Planck PDE, we proceed as follows. First, we employ deep neural networks to approximate the drift and diffusion terms of the SDE by solving appropriate supervised learning tasks. Subsequently, we solve a steady-state Fokker-Plank equation associated with the estimated drift and diffusion coefﬁcients with a neural-network-based least-squares method. We establish the convergence of the proposed scheme under appropriate mathematical assumptions, accounting for the generalization errors induced by regressing the drift and diffusion coefﬁcients, and the PDE solvers. This theoretical study relies on a recent perturbation theory of Markov chain result that shows a linear dependence of the density estimation to the error in estimating the drift term, and generalization error results of nonparametric regression and of PDE regression solution obtained with neural-network models. The effectiveness of this method is reﬂected by numerical simulations of a two-dimensional Student’s t distribution and a 20-dimensional Langevin dynamics.},

	abstract = {Creating noise from data is easy; creating data from noise is generative modeling. We present a stochastic differential equation (SDE) that smoothly transforms a complex data distribution to a known prior distribution by slowly injecting noise, and a corresponding reverse-time SDE that transforms the prior distribution back into the data distribution by slowly removing the noise. Crucially, the reverse-time SDE depends only on the time-dependent gradient field (a.k.a., score) of the perturbed data distribution. By leveraging advances in score-based generative modeling, we can accurately estimate these scores with neural networks, and use numerical SDE solvers to generate samples. We show that this framework encapsulates previous approaches in score-based generative modeling and diffusion probabilistic modeling, allowing for new sampling procedures and new modeling capabilities. In particular, we introduce a predictor-corrector framework to correct errors in the evolution of the discretized reverse-time SDE. We also derive an equivalent neural ODE that samples from the same distribution as the SDE, but additionally enables exact likelihood computation, and improved sampling efficiency. In addition, we provide a new way to solve inverse problems with score-based models, as demonstrated with experiments on class-conditional generation, image inpainting, and colorization. Combined with multiple architectural improvements, we achieve record-breaking performance for unconditional image generation on CIFAR-10 with an Inception score of 9.89 and FID of 2.20, a competitive likelihood of 2.99 bits/dim, and demonstrate high fidelity generation of \$1024{\textbackslash}times 1024\$ images for the first time from a score-based generative model.},

In these systems, function emerges from sophisticated molecular design; for example, intrinsically disordered proteins leverage speciﬁc sequences of monomeric charges to control the formation and function of intracellular compartments known as membraneless organelles. The role of a charged monomer sequence in dictating the strength of electrostatic interactions remains poorly understood despite extensive evidence that sequence is a powerful tool biology uses to tune soft materials. In this article, we use a combination of theory, experiment, and simulation to establish the physical principles governing sequence-driven control of electrostatic interactions. We predict how arbitrary sequences of charge give rise to drastic changes in electrostatic interactions and correspondingly phase behavior. We generalize a transfer matrix formalism that describes a phase separation phenomenon known as “complex coacervation” and provide a theoretical framework to predict the phase behavior of charge sequences. This work thus provides insights into both how charge sequence is used in biology and how it could be used to engineer properties of synthetic polymer systems.},

Conceptually situated between supervised and unsupervised learning, it permits harnessing the large amounts of unlabelled data available in many use cases in combination with typically smaller sets of labelled data. In recent years, research in this area has followed the general trends observed in machine learning, with much attention directed at neural network-based models and generative learning. The literature on the topic has also expanded in volume and scope, now encompassing a broad spectrum of theory, algorithms and applications. However, no recent surveys exist to collect and organize this knowledge, impeding the ability of researchers and engineers alike to utilize it. Filling this void, we present an up-to-date overview of semi-supervised learning methods, covering earlier work as well as more recent advances. We focus primarily on semi-supervised classiﬁcation, where the large majority of semi-supervised learning research takes place. Our survey aims to provide researchers and practitioners new to the ﬁeld as well as more advanced readers with a solid understanding of the main approaches and algorithms developed over the past two decades, with an emphasis on the most prominent and currently relevant work. Furthermore, we propose a new taxonomy of semi-supervised classiﬁcation algorithms, which sheds light on the different conceptual and methodological approaches for incorporating unlabelled data into the training process. Lastly, we show how the fundamental assumptions underlying most semi-supervised learning algorithms are closely connected to each other, and how they relate to the well-known semi-supervised clustering assumption.},

	abstract = {The distinct physical properties of hybrid organic–inorganic materials can lead to unexpected nonequilibrium phenomena that are difficult to characterize due to the broad range of length and time scales involved. For instance, mixed halide hybrid perovskites are promising materials for optoelectronics, yet bulk measurements suggest the halides reversibly phase separate upon photoexcitation. By combining nanoscale imaging and multiscale modeling, we find that the nature of halide demixing in these materials is distinct from macroscopic phase separation. We propose that the localized strain induced by a single photoexcited charge interacting with the soft, ionic lattice is sufficient to promote halide phase separation and nucleate a light-stabilized, low-bandgap, ∼8 nm iodide-rich cluster. The limited extent of this polaron is essential to promote demixing because by contrast bulk strain would simply be relaxed. Photoinduced phase separation is therefore a consequence of the unique electromechanical properties of this hybrid class of materials. Exploiting photoinduced phase separation and other nonequilibrium phenomena in hybrid materials more generally could expand applications in sensing, switching, memory, and energy storage.},

However, the eﬀective potentials that govern CG models are conﬁguration-dependent free energies with signiﬁcant entropic contributions that have important consequences for the transferability and thermodynamic properties of CG models. This review summarizes recent work investigating the fundamental origin and practical ramiﬁcations of these entropic contributions, as well as their sensitivity to the CG mapping. We ﬁrst analyze the energetic and entropic components of the many-body potential of mean force. By adopting a simple model for protein ﬂuctuations, we examine how these components vary with the CG representation. We then introduce a “dual potential” approach for addressing these entropic considerations in more complex systems, such as ortho-terphenyl (OTP). We demonstrate that this dual approach not only accurately describes the structure and energetic properties of the underlying atomic model, but also accurately predicts the temperature-dependence of the CG potentials. Furthermore, by considering two diﬀerent CG representations of OTP, we elucidate how these contributions vary with resolution. In sum, we hope this work will prove useful for improving the transferability and thermodynamic properties of CG models for soft materials.},

The computer-aided investigation of many biological physics problems thus largely beneﬁts from the usage of coarse-grained models, that is, simpliﬁed representations of a molecule at a level of resolution that is lower than atomistic. A plethora of coarse-grained models have been developed, which differ most notably in their granularity; this latter aspect determines one of the crucial open issues in the ﬁeld, i.e. the identiﬁcation of an optimal degree of coarsening, which enables the greatest simpliﬁcation at the expenses of the smallest information loss. In this review, we present the problem of coarse-grained modeling in biophysics from the viewpoint of system representation and information content. In particular, we discuss two distinct yet complementary aspects of protein modeling: on the one hand, the relationship between the resolution of a model and its capacity of accurately reproducing the properties of interest; on the other hand, the possibility of employing a lower resolution description of a detailed model to extract simple, useful, and intelligible information from the latter.},

	abstract = {Large-scale computational molecular models provide scientists a means to investigate the effect of microscopic details on emergent mesoscopic behavior. Elucidating the relationship between variations on the molecular scale and macroscopic observable properties facilitates an understanding of the molecular interactions driving the properties of real world materials and complex systems (e.g., those found in biology, chemistry, and materials science). As a result, discovering an explicit, systematic connection between microscopic nature and emergent mesoscopic behavior is a fundamental goal for this type of investigation. The molecular forces critical to driving the behavior of complex heterogeneous systems are often unclear. More problematically, simulations of representative model systems are often prohibitively expensive from both spatial and temporal perspectives, impeding straightforward investigations over possible hypotheses characterizing molecular behavior. While the reduction in resolution of a study, such as moving from an atomistic simulation to that of the resolution of large coarse-grained (CG) groups of atoms, can partially ameliorate the cost of individual simulations, the relationship between the proposed microscopic details and this intermediate resolution is nontrivial and presents new obstacles to study. Small portions of these complex systems can be realistically simulated. Alone, these smaller simulations likely do not provide insight into collectively emergent behavior. However, by proposing that the driving forces in both smaller and larger systems (containing many related copies of the smaller system) have an explicit connection, systematic bottom-up CG techniques can be used to transfer CG hypotheses discovered using a smaller scale system to a larger system of primary interest. The proposed connection between different CG systems is prescribed by (i) the CG representation (mapping) and (ii) the functional form and parameters used to represent the CG energetics, which approximate potentials of mean force (PMFs). As a result, the design of CG methods that facilitate a variety of physically relevant representations, approximations, and force fields is critical to moving the frontier of systematic CG forward. Crucially, the proposed connection between the system used for parametrization and the system of interest is orthogonal to the optimization used to approximate the potential of mean force present in all systematic CG methods. The empirical efficacy of machine learning techniques on a variety of tasks provides strong motivation to consider these approaches for approximating the PMF and analyzing these approximations.},

Recently, the Electronic Coarse-Graining (ECG) method was introduced to renormalize all-atom quantum chemical (QC) predictions to coarse-grained (CG) resolutions using deep neural networks (DNNs). While DNNs can learn complex representations that prove challenging for kernel-based methods, they are susceptible to overﬁtting and the overconﬁdence of uncertainty estimations. Here, we develop ECG within a GPUaccelerated Deep Kernel Learning (DKL) framework to enable CG QC predictions using range-separated hybrid density functional theory (DFT), obtaining a 107 speedup relative to naive all-atom QC. By treating the predicted electronic properties as random Gaussian Processes, DKL incorporates CG mapping degeneracy by learning the distribution of electronic energies as a function of CG conﬁguration. DKL-ECG accurately reproduces molecular orbital energies from range-separated DFT while facilitating eﬃcient training via active learning using the uncertainties provided by DKL. We show that while active learning algorithms enable eﬃcient sampling of a more diverse conﬁgurational space relative to random sampling, all explored query methods exhibit comparable performance for the examined system. We attribute this result to the signiﬁcant overlap of the feature space and output property distributions across multiple temperatures.},

However, coarse-grained (CG) models produced with such methods frequently fail to accurately reproduce all thermodynamic properties of the reference atomistic systems they seek to model and, moreover, can fail in even more significant ways when used at thermodynamic state points different from the reference conditions. These related problems of representability and transferability limit the usefulness of CG models, especially those of strongly state-dependent systems. In this work, we present a new strategy for creating temperature-transferable CG models using a single reference system and temperature. The approach is based on two complementary concepts. First, we switch to a microcanonical basis for formulating CG models, focusing on effective entropy functions rather than energy functions. This allows CG models to naturally represent information about underlying atomistic energy fluctuations, which would otherwise be lost. Such information not only reproduces energy distributions of the reference model but also successfully predicts the correct temperature dependence of the CG interactions, enabling temperature transferability. Second, we show that relative entropy minimization provides a direct and systematic approach to parameterize such classes of temperature-transferable CG models. We calibrate the approach initially using idealized model systems and then demonstrate its ability to create temperature-transferable CG models for several complex molecular liquids.},

The certainties of predictive CG distributions are shown to be limited by CG model resolution with DKL-ECG predictive noise converging to the intrinsic physical noise induced by the CG mapping operator for multiple chemistries. Further analysis of the resolution dependence of learned CG property distributions allows for the identification of CG mapping operators that capture CG degrees of freedom with strong electron–phonon coupling. We further demonstrate the ability to construct the exact quantum chemical valence electronic density of states (EDOS), including behavior in the tails of the EDOS, from an entirely CG model by combining iterative Boltzmann inversion and DKL-ECG. DKL-ECG provides a means of learning CG distributions of all-atom properties that are traditionally “lost” in CG model development, introducing a promising methodological alternative to backmapping algorithms commonly employed to recover all-atom property distributions from CG simulations.},

Specifically, we construct implicit solvent models at various resolutions, R, by retaining a fraction 0.10 ≤ R ≤ 0.95 of the molecules from a simple fluid of Lennard-Jones spheres. We consider the dual-potential approach in both the constant volume and constant pressure ensembles across a relatively wide range of temperatures. We approximate the many-body potential of mean force for the remaining solutes with pair and volume potentials, which we determine via multiscale coarse-graining and selfconsistent pressure-matching, respectively. Interestingly, with increasing temperature, the pair potentials appear increasingly attractive, while the volume potentials become increasingly repulsive. The dual-potential approach not only reproduces the atomic energetics but also quite accurately predicts this temperature-dependence. We also derive an exact relationship between the thermodynamic specific heat of an atomic model and the energetic fluctuations that are observable at the CG resolution. With this generalized fluctuation relationship, the approximate CG models quite accurately reproduce the thermodynamic specific heat of the underlying atomic model.},

            Physical phenomena can often be described by surprisingly few order parameters. Unfortunately, it is challenging to identify these essential degrees of freedom. Here we develop a statistical physics framework for exploring the landscape of order parameters, or coarse-grained representations, for a microscopic protein model. We employ Monte Carlo methods to statistically characterize this landscape. We define metrics assessing the intrinsic quality of each representation for preserving the configurational information and large-scale motions of the underlying microscopic model. Interestingly, these metrics are anticorrelated in low-resolution representations. Moreover, below a critical resolution, a phase transition qualitatively distinguishes superior and inferior representations. Finally, we relate our work to recent approaches for clustering graphs and detecting communities in networks.

              The success of any physical model critically depends upon adopting an appropriate representation for the phenomenon of interest. Unfortunately, it remains generally challenging to identify the essential degrees of freedom or, equivalently, the proper order parameters for describing complex phenomena. Here we develop a statistical physics framework for exploring and quantitatively characterizing the space of order parameters for representing physical systems. Specifically, we examine the space of low-resolution representations that correspond to particle-based coarse-grained (CG) models for a simple microscopic model of protein fluctuations. We employ Monte Carlo (MC) methods to sample this space and determine the density of states for CG representations as a function of their ability to preserve the configurational information,

	abstract = {Coarse-grained (CG) models of biomolecules have recently attracted considerable interest because they enable the simulation of complex biological systems on length-scales and timescales that are inaccessible for atomistic molecular dynamics simulation. A CG model is deﬁned by a map that transforms an atomically detailed conﬁguration into a CG conﬁguration. For CG models of relatively small biomolecules or in cases that the CG and all-atom models have similar resolution, the construction of this map is relatively straightforward and can be guided by chemical intuition. However, it is more challenging to construct a CG map when large and complex domains of biomolecules have to be represented by relatively few CG sites. This work introduces a new and systematic methodology called essential dynamics coarse-graining (ED-CG). This approach constructs a CG map of the primary sequence at a chosen resolution for an arbitrarily complex biomolecule. In particular, the resulting ED-CG method variationally determines the CG sites that reﬂect the essential dynamics characterized by principal component analysis of an atomistic molecular dynamics trajectory. Numerical calculations illustrate this approach for the HIV-1 CA protein dimer and ATPbound G-actin. Importantly, since the CG sites are constructed from the primary sequence of the biomolecule, the resulting ED-CG model may be better suited to appropriately explore protein conformational space than those from other CG methods at the same degree of resolution.},

	abstract = {A novel methodology is introduced here to generate coarse-grained (CG) representations of molecular models for simulations. The proposed strategy relies on basic graph-theoretic principles and is referred to as graph-based coarse-graining (GBCG). It treats a given system as a molecular graph and derives a corresponding CG representation by using edge contractions to combine nodes in the graph, which correspond to atoms in the molecule, into CG sites. A key element of this methodology is that the nodes are combined according to well-deﬁned protocols that rank-order nodes based on the underlying chemical connectivity. By iteratively performing these operations, successively coarser representations of the original atomic system can be produced to yield a systematic set of CG mappings with hierarchical resolution in an automated fashion. These capabilities are demonstrated in the context of several test systems, including toluene, pentadecane, a polysaccharide dimer, and a rhodopsin protein. In these examples, GBCG yields multiple, intuitive structures that naturally preserve the chemical topology of the system. Importantly, these representations are rendered from algorithmic implementation rather than an arbitrary ansatz, which, until now, has been the conventional approach for deﬁning CG mapping schemes. Overall, the results presented here indicate that GBCG is eﬃcient, robust, and unambiguous in its application, making it a valuable tool for future CG modeling.},

	abstract = {A simple generative model based on a continuous-time normalizing flow between any pair of base and target probability densities is proposed. The velocity field of this flow is inferred from the probability current of a time-dependent density that interpolates between the base and the target in finite time. Unlike conventional normalizing flow inference methods based the maximum likelihood principle, which require costly backpropagation through ODE solvers, our interpolant approach leads to a simple quadratic loss for the velocity itself which is expressed in terms of expectations that are readily amenable to empirical estimation. The flow can be used to generate samples from either the base or target, and to estimate the likelihood at any time along the interpolant. In addition, the flow can be optimized to minimize the path length of the interpolant density, thereby paving the way for building optimal transport maps. The approach is also contextualized in its relation to diffusions. In particular, in situations where the base is a Gaussian density, we show that the velocity of our normalizing flow can also be used to construct a diffusion model to sample the target as well as estimating its score. This allows one to map methods based on stochastic differential equations to those using ordinary differential equations, simplifying the mechanics of the model, but capturing equivalent dynamics. Benchmarking on density estimation tasks illustrates that the learned flow can match and surpass maximum likelihood continuous flows at a fraction of the conventional ODE training costs.},

	abstract = {Emerging sampling algorithms based on normalizing flows have the potential to solve ergodicity problems in lattice calculations. Furthermore, it has been noted that flows can be used to compute thermodynamic quantities which are difficult to access with traditional methods. This suggests that they are also applicable to the density-of-states approach to complex action problems. In particular, flow-based sampling may be used to compute the density directly, in contradistinction to the conventional strategy of reconstructing it via measuring and integrating the derivative of its logarithm. By circumventing this procedure, the accumulation of errors from the numerical integration is avoided completely and the overall normalization factor can be determined explicitly. In this proof-of-principle study, we demonstrate our method in the context of two-component scalar field theory where the \$O(2)\$ symmetry is explicitly broken by an imaginary external field. First, we concentrate on the zero-dimensional case which can be solved exactly. We show that with our method, the Lee-Yang zeroes of the associated partition function can be successfully located. Subsequently, we confirm that the flow-based approach correctly reproduces the density computed with conventional methods in one- and two-dimensional models.},

	abstract = {Forecasting the likelihood, timing, and nature of events is a major goal of modeling stochastic dynamical systems. When the event is rare in comparison with the timescales of simulation and/or measurement needed to resolve the elemental dynamics, accurate forecasting from direct observations becomes challenging. In such cases a more effective approach is to cast statistics of interest as solutions to Feynman-Kac equations (partial differential equations). Here, we develop an approach to solve Feynman-Kac equations by training neural networks on short-trajectory data. Unlike previous approaches, our method avoids assumptions about the underlying model and dynamics. This makes it applicable to treating complex computational models and observational data. We illustrate the advantages of our method using a low-dimensional model that facilitates visualization, and this analysis motivates an adaptive sampling strategy that allows on-the-fly identification of and addition of data to regions important for predicting the statistics of interest. Finally, we demonstrate that we can compute accurate statistics for a 75-dimensional model of sudden stratospheric warming. This system provides a stringent test bed for our method.},

This method transports a set of particles using not only importance sampling (IS), Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and resampling steps - as in SMC, but also relies on NFs which are learned sequentially to push particles towards the successive annealed targets. We provide limit theorems for the resulting Monte Carlo estimates of the normalizing constant and expectations with respect to the target distribution.

	abstract = {The autoregressive neural networks are emerging as a powerful computational tool to solve relevant problems in classical and quantum mechanics. One of their appealing functionalities is that, after they have learned a probability distribution from a dataset, they allow exact and efficient sampling of typical system configurations. Here we employ a neural autoregressive distribution estimator (NADE) to boost Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulations of a paradigmatic classical model of spin-glass theory, namely, the two-dimensional Edwards-Anderson Hamiltonian. We show that a NADE can be trained to accurately mimic the Boltzmann distribution using unsupervised learning from system configurations generated using standard MCMC algorithms. The trained NADE is then employed as smart proposal distribution for the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. This allows us to perform efficient MCMC simulations, which provide unbiased results even if the expectation value corresponding to the probability distribution learned by the NADE is not exact. Notably, we implement a sequential tempering procedure, whereby a NADE trained at a higher temperature is iteratively employed as proposal distribution in a MCMC simulation run at a slightly lower temperature. This allows one to efficiently simulate the spin-glass model even in the low-temperature regime, avoiding the divergent correlation times that plague MCMC simulations driven by local-update algorithms. Furthermore, we show that the NADE-driven simulations quickly sample ground-state configurations, paving the way to their future utilization to tackle binary optimization problems.},

	abstract = {Both natural ecosystems and biochemical reaction networks involve populations of heterogeneous agents whose cooperative and competitive interactions lead to a rich dynamics of species' abundances, albeit at vastly different scales. The maintenance of diversity in large ecosystems is a longstanding puzzle, towards which recent progress has been made by the derivation of dynamical mean-field theories of random models. In particular, it has recently been shown that these random models have a chaotic phase in which abundances display wild fluctuations. When modest spatial structure is included, these fluctuations are stabilized and diversity is maintained. If and how these phenomena have parallels in biochemical reaction networks is currently unknown. Making this connection is of interest since life requires cooperation among a large number of molecular species. In this work, we find a reaction network whose large-scale behavior recovers the random Lotka-Volterra model recently considered in theoretical ecology. We clarify the assumptions necessary to derive its large-scale description, and reveal the underlying assumptions made on the noise to recover previous dynamical mean-field theories. Then, we show how local detailed balance and the positivity of reaction rates, which are key physical requirements of chemical reaction networks, provide obstructions towards the construction of an associated dynamical mean-field theory of biochemical reaction networks. Finally, we outline prospects and challenges for the future.},

Despite years of successful applications, transfer learning practice often relies on ad-hoc solutions, while theoretical understanding of these procedures is still limited. In the present work, we re-think a solvable model of synthetic data as a framework for modeling correlation between data-sets. This setup allows for an analytic characterization of the generalization performance obtained when transferring the learned feature map from the source to the target task. Focusing on the problem of training two-layer networks in a binary classification setting, we show that our model can capture a range of salient features of transfer learning with real data. Moreover, by exploiting parametric control over the correlation between the two data-sets, we systematically investigate under which conditions the transfer of features is beneficial for generalization.},

The method has been parameterized from accurate parmbsc1 atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of all unique tetranucleotide sequences of DNA embedded in long duplexes and takes advantage of the correlation between helical states and backbone configurations to derive atomistic representations of DNA. The algorithm, which is implemented in a simple web interface and in a standalone package reproduces with high computational efficiency the structural landscape of long segments of DNA untreatable by atomistic molecular dynamics simulations.},

They also manifest non-conservative forces, and the motions of the nano-particles are overdamped; i.e., they exhibit diffusive trajectories. We propose a data-driven approach based on principal components analysis (PCA) to determine the collective modes of non-conservative overdamped systems, such as OM structures, and harmonic linear discriminant analysis (HLDA) of time trajectories to estimate the reaction coordinate for structural transitions. We demonstrate the approach via electrodynamics-Langevin dynamics simulations of six electrodynamically-bound nanoparticles in an incident laser beam. The reaction coordinate we discover is in excellent accord with a rigorous committor analysis, and the identified mechanism for structural isomerization is in very good agreement with the experimental observations. The PCA-HLDA approach to data-driven discovery of reaction coordinates can aid in understanding and eventually controlling non-conservative and overdamped systems including optical and active matter systems.},

	abstract = {The reaction coordinate (RC) is the principal collective variable or feature that determines the progress along an activated or reactive process. In a molecular simulation using enhanced sampling, a good description of the RC is crucial for generating sufficient statistics. Moreover, the RC provides invaluable atomistic insight into the process under study. The optimal RC is the committor, which represents the likelihood of a system to evolve toward a given state based on the coordinates of all its particles. As the interpretability of such a high dimensional function is low, a more practical approach is to describe the RC by some low-dimensional molecular collective variables or order parameters. While several methods can perform this dimensionality reduction, they usually require a preselection of these low-dimension collective variables (CVs). Here, we propose to automate this dimensionality reduction using an extended autoencoder, which maps the input (many CVs) onto a lower-dimensional latent space, which is subsequently used for the reconstruction of the input as well as the prediction of the committor function. As a consequence, the latent space is optimized for both reconstruction and committor prediction and is likely to yield the best non-linear low-dimensional representation of the committor. We test our extended autoencoder model on simple but nontrivial toy systems, as well as extensive molecular simulation data of methane hydrate nucleation. The extended autoencoder model can effectively extract the underlying mechanism of a reaction, make reliable predictions about the committor of a given configuration, and potentially even generate new paths representative for a reaction.},

We exemplify its usefulness by achieving more than 40 times acceleration in simulating two model biophysical systems through well-tempered metadynamics performed by biasing along the SPIB-learned reaction coordinate. These include left- to right-handed chirality transitions in a synthetic helical peptide (Aib)9 and permeation of a small benzoic acid molecule through a synthetic, symmetric phospholipid bilayer. In addition to significantly accelerating the dynamics and achieving back and forth movement between different metastable states, the SPIB-based reaction coordinate gives mechanistic insights into the processes driving these two important problems.},

	abstract = {Spectral gap optimization of order parameters (SGOOP) [P. Tiwary and B. J. Berne, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A. 113, 2839 (2016)] is a method for constructing the reaction coordinate (RC) in molecular systems, especially when they are plagued with hard to sample rare events, given a larger dictionary of order parameters or basis functions and limited static and dynamic information about the system. In its original formulation, SGOOP is designed to construct a 1-dimensional RC. Here we extend its scope by introducing a simple but powerful extension based on the notion of conditional probability factorization where known features are effectively washed out to learn additional and possibly hidden features of the energy landscape. We show how SGOOP can be used to proceed in a sequential and bottom-up manner to (i) systematically probe the need for extending the dimensionality of the RC and (ii) if such a need is identified, learn additional coordinates of the RC in a computationally efficient manner. We formulate the method and demonstrate its utility through three illustrative examples, including the challenging and important problem of calculating the kinetics of benzene unbinding from the protein T4L99A lysozyme, where we obtain excellent agreement in terms of dissociation pathway and kinetics with other sampling methods and experiments. In this last case, starting from a larger dictionary of 11 order parameters that are generic for ligand unbinding processes, we demonstrate how to automatically learn a 2-dimensional RC, which we then use in the infrequent metadynamics protocol to obtain 16 independent unbinding trajectories. We believe our method will be a big step in increasing the utility of SGOOP in performing intuition-free sampling of complex systems. Finally, we believe that the utility of our protocol is amplified by its applicability to not just SGOOP but also other generic methods for constructing the RC.},

Variational methods based on information from simulations of finer-grained (e.g., all-atom) models, for example the multiscale coarse-graining (MS-CG) and relative entropy minimization methods, provide attractive tools for the systematic development of CG models. However, these methods have important drawbacks when used in the “ultra-coarse-grained” (UCG) regime, e.g., at a resolution level coarser or much coarser than one amino acid residue per effective CG particle in proteins. This is due to the possible existence of multiple metastable states “within” the CG sites for a given UCG model configuration. In this work, systematic variational UCG methods are presented that are specifically designed to CG entire protein domains and subdomains into single effective CG particles. This is accomplished by augmenting existing effective particle CG schemes to allow for discrete state transitions and configuration-dependent resolution. Additionally, certain conclusions of this work connect back to single-state force matching and open up new avenues for method development in that area. These results provide a formal statistical mechanical basis for UCG methods related to force matching and relative entropy CG methods and suggest practical algorithms for constructing optimal approximate UCG models from fine-grained simulation data.},

The ability of such models to reproduce the essential features of folding dynamics suggests that each single atomic degree of freedom is not by itself particularly relevant to folding and supports a statistical mechanical approach to characterize folding transitions. When combined with more refined models and with experimental studies, the systematic investigation of protein systems and complexes using coarse-grained models can advance our theoretical understanding of the actual organizing principles that emerge from the complex network of interactions among protein atomic constituents.},

Our implementation of WTMD proves effective at locating the ODT of the lamellar and cylindrical regions, but it has difficulty with that of the spherical and gyroid regions. In the latter two cases, our choice of order parameter cannot sufficiently distinguish the ordered and disordered states because of the similarity in microstructures. The gyroid phase has the added complication that it competes with a number of other morphologies, and thus, it might be beneficial to extend the WTMD to multiple order parameters.

Here, we used organocatalytic ring opening polymerization to produce amphiphilic block copolymers for the formation of nanoparticle drug carriers with enhanced stability, cargo encapsulation, and sustained delivery. These polymers comprised blocks of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), poly(valerolactone) (PVL), and poly(lactide) (PLA). Four particle chemistries were examined: (a) PEG-PLA, (b) PEG-PVL, (c) a physical mixture of PEG–PLA and PEG–PVL, and (d) PEG–PVL–PLA tri-block copolymers. Nanoparticle stability was assessed at room temperature (20 °C; pH = 7), physiological temperature (37 °C; pH = 7), in acidic media (37 °C; pH = 2), and with a digestive enzyme (lipase; 37 °C; pH = 7.4). PVL-based nanoparticles demonstrated the highest level of stability at room temperature, 37 °C and acidic conditions, but were rapidly degraded by lipase. Moreover, PVL-based nanoparticles demonstrated good cargo encapsulation, but rapid release. In contrast, PLA-based nanoparticles demonstrated poor stability and encapsulation, but sustained release. The PEG–PVL–PLA nanoparticles exhibited the best combination of stability, encapsulation, and release properties.

It is widely accepted that the dynamics of the membrane proteins is determined either by the interactions of the transmembrane domain with the surrounding lipids or by the interactions of the intracellular domain with cytosolic components such as cortical actin. Although initiation of different cellular signaling events at the plasma membrane has been attributed to the extracellular domain (ECD) properties recently, the impact of ECDs Journal Pre-proof on the dynamic behavior of membrane proteins is rather unexplored. Here, we investigate how the ECD properties influence protein dynamics in the lipid bilayer by reconstituting ECDs of different sizes or glycosylation in model membrane systems and analyzing ECD-driven protein sorting in lipid domains as well as protein mobility. Our data shows that increasing the ECD mass or glycosylation leads to a decrease in ordered domain partitioning and diffusivity. Our data reconciles different mechanisms proposed for the initiation of cellular signaling by linking the ECD size of membrane proteins with their localization and diffusion dynamics in the plasma membrane.},

            The generalized Langevin equation (GLE) provides a precise description of coarse-grained variable dynamics in reduced dimension models. However, computation of the memory kernel poses a major challenge to the practical use of the GLE. This paper presents a data-driven approach to compute the memory kernel, relying on a hierarchy of parameterized rational approximations in terms of the Laplace transform, which can be expanded to arbitrarily high order as necessary. This parameterization makes it convenient to represent the GLE via an extended stochastic model where the memory term is eliminated by properly introducing auxiliary variables. The present method is well-suited for constructing reduced models for nonequilibrium properties of complex systems such as biomolecules, chemical reaction networks, and climate simulations.
          , 
            We present a data-driven approach to determine the memory kernel and random noise in generalized Langevin equations. To facilitate practical implementations, we parameterize the kernel function in the Laplace domain by a rational function, with coefficients directly linked to the equilibrium statistics of the coarse-grain variables. We show that such an approximation can be constructed to arbitrarily high order and the resulting generalized Langevin dynamics can be embedded in an extended stochastic model without explicit memory. We demonstrate how to introduce the stochastic noise so that the second fluctuation-dissipation theorem is exactly satisfied. Results from several numerical tests are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Yet the mechanisms of these transformations, which often operate far from equilibrium and entail mixing diverse chemical species, remain poorly understood. Here, we explore an idealized model for ion exchange in which a chemical potential drives compositional defects to accumulate at a crystal's surface. These impurities subsequently diffuse inward. We find that the nature of interactions between sites in a compositionally impure crystal strongly impacts exchange trajectories. In particular, elastic deformations which accompany lattice-mismatched species promote spatially modulated patterns in the composition. These same patterns can be produced at equilibrium in core/shell nanocrystals, whose structure mimics transient motifs observed in nonequilibrium trajectories. Moreover, the core of such nanocrystals undergoes a phase transition - from modulated to unstructured - as the thickness or stiffness of the shell is decreased. Our results help explain the varied patterns observed in heterostructured nanocrystals produced by ion exchange and suggest principles for the rational design of compositionally-patterned nanomaterials.},

While this approach can successfully account for basic length and energy scales of ion solvation, computer simulations indicate not only its quantitative inaccuracies but also its inability to capture some basic and important aspects of microscopic polarization response. Here we consider one such shortcoming, a failure to distinguish the solvation thermodynamics of cations from that of otherwise-identical anions, and we pursue a simple, physically inspired modification of the dielectric continuum model to address it. The adaptation is motivated by analyzing the orientational response of an isolated water molecule whose dipole is rigidly constrained. Its free energy suggests a Hamiltonian for dipole fluctuations that accounts implicitly for the influence of higher-order multipole moments, while respecting constraints of molecular geometry. We propose a field theory with the suggested form, whose nonlinear response breaks the charge symmetry of ion solvation. An approximate variational solution of this theory, with a single adjustable parameter, yields solvation free energies that agree closely with simulation results over a considerable range of solute size and charge.},

	abstract = {The collective behavior of lipids with diverse chemical and physical features determines a membrane’s thermodynamic properties. Yet, the inﬂuence of lipid physicochemical properties on lipid dynamics, in particular interbilayer transport, remains underexplored. Here, we systematically investigate how the activation free energy of passive lipid transport depends on lipid chemistry and membrane phase. Through all-atom molecular dynamics simulations of 11 chemically distinct glycerophospholipids, we determine how lipid acyl chain length, unsaturation, and headgroup inﬂuence the free energy barriers for two elementary steps of lipid transport, lipid desorption, which is rate-limiting, and lipid insertion into a membrane. Consistent with previous experimental measurements, we ﬁnd that lipids with longer, saturated acyl chains have increased activation free energies compared to lipids with shorter, unsaturated chains. Lipids with diﬀerent headgroups exhibit a range of activation free energies; however, no clear trend based solely on chemical structure can be identiﬁed, mirroring diﬃculties in the interpretation of previous experimental results. Compared to liquid-crystalline phase membranes, gel phase membranes exhibit substantially increased free energy barriers. Overall, we ﬁnd that the activation free energy depends on a lipid’s local hydrophobic environment in a membrane and that the free energy barrier for lipid insertion depends on a membrane’s interfacial hydrophobicity. Both of these properties can be altered through changes in lipid acyl chain length, lipid headgroup, and membrane phase. Thus, the rate of lipid transport can be tuned through subtle changes in local membrane composition and order, suggesting an unappreciated role for nanoscale membrane domains in regulating cellular lipid dynamics.},

At an activity just above the MIPS critical point, the liquid-gas binodal is superseded by the crystal-fluid coexistence curve, with solid, liquid, and gas all coexisting at the triple point where the two curves intersect. Nucleating an active crystal from a disordered fluid, however, requires a rare fluctuation that exhibits the nearly close-packed density of the solid phase. The corresponding barrier to crystallization is surmountable on a feasible timescale only at high activity, and only at fluid densities near maximal packing. The glassiness expected for such dense liquids at equilibrium is strongly mitigated by active forces, so that the lifetime of liquid-gas coexistence declines steadily with increasing activity, manifesting in simulations as a facile spontaneous crystallization at extremely high activity.},

To understand the interfacial behavior of NPSs, it is necessary to understand the mechanism by which the NPSs attach to the interface and how this attachment depends on the areal coverage of the interface. Through direct observation with high spatial and temporal resolution, using laser scanning confocal microscopy and in situ atomic force microscopy (AFM), we observe that early-stage attachment of NPs to the interface is diffusion limited and with increasing areal density of the NPSs, further attachment requires cooperative displacement of the previously assembled NPSs both laterally and vertically. The unprecedented detail provided by in situ AFM reveals the complex mechanism of attachment and the deeply nonequilibrium nature of the assembly.},

          , 
            Anions generally associate more favorably with the air–water interface than cations. In addition to solute size and polarizability, the intrinsic structure of the unperturbed interface has been discussed as an important contributor to this bias. Here we assess quantitatively the role that intrinsic charge asymmetry of water's surface plays in ion adsorption, using computer simulations to compare model solutes of various size and charge. In doing so, we also evaluate the degree to which linear response theory for solvent polarization is a reasonable approach for comparing the thermodynamics of bulk and interfacial ion solvation. Consistent with previous works on bulk ion solvation, we find that the average electrostatic potential at the center of a neutral, sub-nanometer solute at the air–water interface depends sensitively on its radius, and that this potential changes quite nonlinearly as the solute's charge is introduced. The nonlinear response closely resembles that of the bulk. As a result, the net nonlinearity of ion adsorption is weaker than in bulk, but still substantial, comparable to the apparent magnitude of macroscopically nonlocal contributions from the undisturbed interface. For the simple-point-charge model of water we study, these results argue distinctly against rationalizing ion adsorption in terms of surface potentials inherent to molecular structure of the liquid's boundary.},

Nanoparticle surfactants, on the other hand, are a promising alternative because the surface chemistry needed to make them bind to a liquid–liquid interface is both well flexible and understood.

Yet, even the simplest process that could be responsible for maintaining proper lipid distributions, passive lipid exchange of individual molecules between membranes, has eluded a detailed understanding, due in part to inconsistencies between experimental ﬁndings and molecular simulations. We resolve these discrepancies by discovering the reaction coordinate for passive lipid exchange, which enables a complete biophysical characterization of the rate-limiting step for lipid exchange. Our approach to identify the reaction coordinate capitalizes on our ability to harvest over 1000 unbiased trajectories of lipid insertion, an elementary step of passive lipid transport, using all-atom and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. We ﬁnd that the reaction coordinate measures the formation and breakage of hydrophobic contacts between the membrane and exchanging lipid. Consistent with experiments, free energy proﬁles as a function of our reaction coordinate exhibit a substantial barrier for insertion. In contrast, lipid insertion was predicted to be a barrier-less process by previous computational studies, which incorrectly presumed the reaction coordinate to be the displacement of the exchanging lipid from the membrane. Utilizing our newfound knowledge of the reaction coordinate, we formulate an expression for the lipid exchange rate to enable a quantitative comparison with experiments. Overall, our results indicate that the breakage of hydrophobic contacts is rate limiting for passive lipid exchange and provide a foundation to understand the catalytic function of lipid transfer proteins.},

	abstract = {Proteins in photosynthetic membranes can organize into patterned arrays that span the membrane’s lateral size. Attractions between proteins in diﬀerent layers of a membrane stack can play a key role in this ordering, as was suggested by microscopy and ﬂuorescence spectroscopy and demonstrated by computer simulations of a coarse-grained model. The architecture of thylakoid membranes, however, also provides opportunities for inter-layer interactions that instead disfavor the high protein densities of ordered arrangements. Here we explore the interplay between these opposing driving forces, and in particular the phase transitions that emerge in the periodic geometry of stacked thylakoid membrane discs. We propose a lattice model that roughly accounts for proteins’ attraction within a layer and across the stromal gap, steric repulsion across the lumenal gap, and regulation of protein density by exchange with the stroma lamellae. Mean ﬁeld analysis and computer simulation reveal rich phase behavior for this simple model, featuring a brokensymmetry striped phase that is disrupted at both high and low extremes of chemical potential. The resulting sensitivity of microscopic protein arrangement to the thylakoid’s mesoscale vertical structure raises intriguing possibilities for regulation of photosynthetic function.},

	abstract = {Creating artiﬁcial systems that mimic and surpass those found in nature is one of the great challenges of modern science. In the context of photosynthetic light harvesting, the diﬃculty lies in attaining utmost control over the energetics, positions and relative orientations of chromophores in densely packed arrays to transfer electronic excitation energy to desired locations with high eﬃciency. Toward achieving this goal, we use a highly versatile biomimetic protein scaﬀold from the tobacco mosaic virus coat protein on which chromophores can be attached at precise locations via linkers of diﬀering lengths and rigidities. We show that minor linker modiﬁcations, including switching chiral conﬁgurations and alkyl chain shortening, lead to signiﬁcant lengthening of the ultrafast excited state dynamics of the system as the linkers are shortened and rigidiﬁed. Molecular dynamics simulations provide molecular-level detail over how the chromophore attachment orientations, positions, and distances from the protein surface lead to the observed trends in system dynamics. In particular, we ﬁnd that short and rigid linkers are able to sandwich water molecules between chromophore and protein, leading to chromophore−water−protein supracomplexes with intricately coupled dynamics that are highly dependent on their local protein environment. In addition, cyclohexyl-based linkers are identiﬁed as ideal candidates to retain rotational correlations over several nanoseconds and thus lock relative chromophore orientations throughout the lifetime of an exciton. Combining linker engineering with judicious placement of chromophores on the hydrated protein scaﬀold to exploit diﬀerent chromophore−bath couplings provides a clear and eﬀective path to producing highly controllable artiﬁcial light-harvesting systems that can increasingly mimic their natural counterparts, thus aiding to elucidate natural photosynthetic mechanisms.},

The identiﬁcation of suitable cysteine sites and appropriate linkers for attachment is generally a lengthy and cumbersome process. Herein, we describe an in silico screening approach that is designed to propose a small number of optimal combinations. By applying this computational approach to human carbonic anhydrase and a set of three photochromic tethered ligands, the number of potential site-ligand combinations was narrowed from over 750 down to 6, which we then evaluated experimentally. Two of these six combinations resulted in light-responsive human Carbonic Anhydrases (LihCAs), which were characterized with enzymatic activity assays, mass spectrometry, and X-ray crystallography. Our study also provides insights into the reactivity of cysteines toward maleimides and the hydrolytic stability of the adducts obtained.},

            The Gibbs free energy of adsorption of a prototypical anion to a graphene/water interface is determined by surface-sensitive spectroscopy and interpreted via molecular dynamics simulations to establish the adsorption mechanism, which is found to be qualitatively different from that operative for the air/water interface and probably representative of a general water/hydrophobe interface.
          , 
            
              The adsorption of ions to aqueous interfaces is a phenomenon that profoundly influences vital processes in many areas of science, including biology, atmospheric chemistry, electrical energy storage, and water process engineering. Although classical electrostatics theory predicts that ions are repelled from water/hydrophobe (e.g., air/water) interfaces, both computer simulations and experiments have shown that chaotropic ions actually exhibit enhanced concentrations at the air/water interface. Although mechanistic pictures have been developed to explain this counterintuitive observation, their general applicability, particularly in the presence of material substrates, remains unclear. Here we investigate ion adsorption to the model interface formed by water and graphene. Deep UV second harmonic generation measurements of the SCN

              ion, a prototypical chaotrope, determined a free energy of adsorption within error of that for air/water. Unlike for the air/water interface, wherein repartitioning of the solvent energy drives ion adsorption, our computer simulations reveal that direct ion/graphene interactions dominate the favorable enthalpy change. Moreover, the graphene sheets dampen capillary waves such that rotational anisotropy of the solute, if present, is the dominant entropy contribution, in contrast to the air/water interface.},

	abstract = {Secondary nucleation pathways in which existing amyloid ﬁbrils catalyze the formation of new aggregates and neurotoxic oligomers are of immediate importance for the onset and progression of Alzheimer’s disease. Here, we apply extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water to study surface-activated secondary nucleation pathways at the extended lateral βsheet surface of a preformed Aβ9−40 ﬁlament. Calculation of free-energy proﬁles allows us to determine binding free energies and conformational intermediates for nucleation complexes consisting of 1−4 Aβ peptides. In addition, we combine the free-energy proﬁles with position-dependent diﬀusion proﬁles to extract complementary kinetic information and macroscopic growth rates. Single monomers bind to the β-sheet surface in a disordered, hydrophobically collapsed conformation, whereas dimers and larger oligomers can retain a cross-β conformation resembling a more ordered ﬁbril structure. The association processes during secondary nucleation follow a dock/lock mechanism consisting of a fast initial encounter phase (docking) and a slow structural rearrangement phase (locking). The major driving forces for surface-activated secondary nucleation are the release of a large number of hydration water molecules and the formation of hydrophobic interface contacts, the latter being in contrast to the elongation process at ﬁlament tips, which is dominated by the formation of stable and highly speciﬁc interface hydrogen bonds. The calculated binding free energies and the association rates for the attachment of Aβ monomers and oligomers to the extended lateral β-sheet surface of the ﬁlament seed are higher compared to those for elongation at the ﬁlament tips, indicating that secondary nucleation pathways can become important once a critical concentration of ﬁlaments has formed.},

	abstract = {Filamentous β-amyloid aggregates are crucial for the pathology of Alzheimer’s disease. Despite the tremendous biomedical importance, the molecular pathway of growth propagation is not completely understood and remains challenging to investigate by simulations due to the long time scales involved. Here, we apply extensive all-atom molecular dynamics simulations in explicit water to obtain free energy proﬁles and kinetic information from position-dependent diﬀusion proﬁles for three diﬀerent Aβ9−40-growth processes: ﬁbril elongation by single monomers at the structurally unequal ﬁlament tips and association of larger ﬁlament fragments. Our approach provides insight into the molecular steps of the kinetic pathway and allows close agreement with experimental binding free energies and macroscopic growth rates. Water plays a decisive role, and solvent entropy is identiﬁed as the main driving force for assembly. Fibril growth is disfavored energetically due to cancellation of direct peptide−peptide interactions and solvation eﬀects. The kinetics of growth is consistent with the characteristic dock/lock mechanism, and docking is at least 2 orders of magnitude faster. During initial docking, interactions are mediated by transient non-native hydrogen bonds, which eﬃciently catch the incoming monomer or fragment already at separations of about 3 nm. In subsequent locking, the dynamics is much slower due to formation of kinetically trapped conformations caused by long-lived non-native hydrogen bonds. Fibril growth additionally requires collective motion of water molecules to create a dry binding interface. Fibril growth is further retarded due to reduced mobility of the involved hydration water, evident from a 2-fold reduction of the diﬀusion coeﬃcient.},

We identify the contributions to the streaming current from speciﬁc ion adsorption at the solid/liquid interface and from long-ranged electrostatic interactions, ﬁnding that the portion originating from the latter dominate at charged surfaces. The detailed understanding aﬀorded by theory and the close agreement with experimental results elucidates design principles for optimizing hydrogen production and power generation. Changing the sign of the surface charge density through targeted use of surface coatings via silanization switches the primary charge carrier between hydronium and hydroxide and therefore switches the corresponding production of molecular hydrogen to oxygen at the target electrode. Moreover, hydrophobic surface coatings reduce dissipation due to ﬂuid/solid friction, thereby increasing the conversion eﬃciency.},

In this work, we examine how changes in the ligand surface coverage and facet dimensions aﬀect the ordering of ligands, the arrangement of nearby solvent molecules, and the interaction between ligand monolayers on diﬀerent particles. In particular, we consider the case of strongly bound octadecyl ligands on the (100) facet of CdS in the presence of an explicit n-hexane solvent. Depending on the facet dimensions and surface coverage, we observe three distinct ordered states that diﬀer in how the ligands are packed together, and which aﬀect the thickness of the ligand shell and the structure of the ligand−solvent interface. The temperature dependence of the order−disorder transition also broadens and shifts to lower temperature in a nonlinear manner as the nanoscale is approached from above. We ﬁnd that ligands on nanoscale facets can behave very similarly to those on macroscopic surfaces in solution, and that some facet dimensions aﬀect the ligand alignment more strongly than others. As the ligands order, the interaction between opposing monolayers becomes attractive, even well below full surface coverage. The strength of attraction per unit surface area is strongly aﬀected by ligand coverage, but only weakly by facet width. Conversely, we ﬁnd that bringing two monolayers together just above the order−disorder transition temperature can induce ordering and attraction.},

Using a highly tunable synthetic platform combined with transient absorption and time-resolved ﬂuorescence measurements and molecular dynamics simulations, we interrogate isolated chromophores covalently linked to diﬀerent positions in the interior of the hydrated nanoscale cavity of a supramolecular protein assembly. We ﬁnd that, following photoexcitation, the time scales over which these chromophores are solvated, undergo conformational rearrangements, and return to the ground state are highly sensitive to their position within this cavity and are signiﬁcantly slower than in a bulk aqueous solution. Molecular dynamics simulations reveal the hindered translations and rotations of water molecules within the protein cavity with spatial speciﬁcity. The results presented herein show that fully hydrated nanoscale protein cavities are a promising way to mimic the tight protein pockets found in natural light-harvesting complexes. We also show that the interplay between protein, solvent, and chromophores can be used to substantially tune the relaxation processes within artiﬁcial light-harvesting assemblies in order to signiﬁcantly improve the yield of interchromophore energy transfer and extend the range of excitation transport. Our observations have implications for other important, similarly sized bioinspired materials, such as nanoreactors and biocompatible targeted delivery agents.},

	abstract = {Basic principles of statistical mechanics require that proteins sample an ensemble of conformations at any nonzero temperature. However, it is still common to treat the crystallographic structure of a protein as the structure of its native state, largely because high-resolution structural characterization of protein ﬂexibility remains a profound challenge. To assess the typical degree of conformational heterogeneity within folded proteins, we construct Markov state models describing the thermodynamics and kinetics of proteins ranging from 72 to 263 residues in length. Each of these models is built from hundreds of microseconds of atomically detailed molecular dynamics simulations. Examination of the side-chain degrees of freedom reveals that almost every residue visits at least two rotameric states over this time frame, with rotamer transition rates spanning a wide range of time scales (from nanoseconds to tens of microseconds). We also report substantial backbone dynamics on time scales longer than are typically addressed by experimental measures of protein ﬂexibility, such as NMR order parameters. Finally, we demonstrate that these extensive rearrangements are consistent with NMR and crystallographic data, which supports the validity of our models. Altogether, these results depict the interior of proteins not as well-ordered solids, as is often imagined, but instead as dense ﬂuids, which undergo substantial structural ﬂuctuations despite their high packing fraction.},

Photoprotection is achieved in part by triggering a series of dissipative processes termed nonphotochemical quenching (NPQ), which depend on the re-organization of photosystem (PS) II supercomplexes in thylakoid membranes. Using atomic force microscopy, we characterized the structural attributes of grana thylakoids from Arabidopsis thaliana to correlate differences in PSII organization with the role of SOQ1, a recently discovered thylakoid protein that prevents formation of a slowly reversible NPQ state. We developed a statistical image analysis suite to discriminate disordered from crystalline particles and classify crystalline arrays according to their unit cell properties. Through detailed analysis of the local organization of PSII supercomplexes in ordered and disordered phases, we found evidence that interactions among light-harvesting antenna complexes are weakened in the absence of SOQ1, inducing protein rearrangements that favor larger separations between PSII complexes in the majority (disordered) phase and reshaping the PSII crystallization landscape. The features we observe are distinct from known protein rearrangements associated with NPQ, providing further support for a role of SOQ1 in a novel NPQ pathway. The particle clustering and unit cell methodology developed here is generalizable to multiple types of microscopy and will enable unbiased analysis and comparison of large data sets.},

In a first step, finite clusters of well-defined structure and composition emerge from natural dynamics with high yield. In effect a kind of patchy particle, these clusters can further assemble into a variety of complex superstructures, including filamentous networks, ordered sheets, and highly porous crystals.},

Vibrational spectroscopy of OH stretching features prominently in these discussions, with an emphasis on efforts to establish connections between spectroscopic signals and statistics of intermolecular structure. For bulk solutions, the results of these efforts largely verify and enrich existing physical pictures of hydrogen-bond network connectivity, dynamics, and response. For water at interfaces, such pictures are still emerging. As an important example I discuss the solvation of small ions at the air-water interface, whose surface propensities challenge a basic understanding of how aqueous ﬂuctuations accommodate solutes in heterogeneous environments.},

PSII-LHCII supercomplexes can be arranged in disordered packings, ordered arrays, or mixtures thereof. The physical driving forces underlying array formation are unknown, complicating attempts to determine a possible functional role for arrays in regulating light harvesting or energy conversion efﬁciency. Here, we introduce a coarse-grained model of protein interactions in coupled photosynthetic membranes, focusing on just two particle types that feature simple shapes and potential energies motivated by structural studies. Reporting on computer simulations of the model’s equilibrium ﬂuctuations, we demonstrate its success in reproducing diverse structural features observed in experiments, including extended PSII-LHCII arrays. Free energy calculations reveal that the appearance of arrays marks a phase transition from the disordered ﬂuid state to a system-spanning crystal. The predicted region of ﬂuid-crystal coexistence is broad, encompassing much of the physiologically relevant parameter regime; we propose experiments that could test this prediction. Our results suggest that grana membranes lie at or near phase coexistence, conferring signiﬁcant structural and functional ﬂexibility to this densely packed membrane protein system.},

Here, we show with molecular dynamics computer simulation that in a model of CdSe/ZnS core/shell nanocrystals the core high-pressure structure can be made metastable under ambient conditions by tuning the thickness of the shell. In nanocrystals with thick shells, we furthermore observe a wurtzite to NiAs transformation, which does not occur in the pure bulk materials. These phenomena are linked to a fundamental change in the atomistic transformation mechanism from heterogeneous nucleation at the surface to homogeneous nucleation in the crystal core.},

We ﬁnd that superlattice formation appears to be segregated into multiple regimes. Initially, the solvent front drags the nanoparticles, condensing them into an amorphous agglomerate. Subsequently, the nanoparticle crystallization into an array is driven by local ﬂuctuations. Following the crystallization event, superlattice growth can also occur via the addition of individual nanoparticles drawn from outlying regions by diﬀerent solvent fronts. The dragging mechanism is consistent with simulations based on a coarse-grained lattice gas model at the same limit.},

By studying the contractile response of cells to dynamic stiffness conditions using an atomic force microscope, we observe a seconds-timescale response to a step change in extracellular stiffness. Speciﬁcally, we observe acceleration in contraction velocity (mm/min) and force rate (nN/min) upon a step decrease in stiffness and deceleration upon a step increase in stiffness. Interestingly, this seconds-timescale response to a change in extracellular stiffness is not altered by inhibiting focal adhesion signaling or stretch-activated ion channels and is independent of cell height and contraction force. Rather, the response timescale is altered only by disrupting cytoskeletal mechanics and is well described by a simple mechanical model of a constant velocity actuator pulling against an internal cellular viscoelastic network. Consistent with the predictions of this model, we ﬁnd that an osmotically expanding hydrogel responds to step changes in extracellular stiffness in a similar manner to cells. We therefore propose that an initial event in stiffness sensing is establishment of a mechanical equilibrium that balances contraction of the viscoelastic cytoskeleton with deformation of the extracellular matrix.},

Negative adsorption enthalpies thus reflect a simple repartitioning of solvent density among surface, bulk, and coordination regions. A different, and much less spatially local, mechanism underlies the concomitant loss of entropy. Simulations indicate that ions at the interface can significantly bias surface height fluctuations even several molecular diameters away, imposing restrictions consistent with the scale of measured and computed adsorption entropies. Based on these results, we expect an ion’s position in the Hofmeister lyotropic series to be determined by a combination of driving forces associated with the pinning of capillary waves and with a competition between ion hydration energy and the neat liquid’s surface tension.},

We show that the ambiguity arises because widely-used approaches, focusing exclusively on electric-dipole contributions from the surface, neglect coordinate-dependent quadrupole-order contributions of comparable magnitude from the bulk. The correct calculation includes both surface and bulk responses. With a judicious choice of molecular center, however, it may be possible to minimize the bulk contribution, allowing the surface-only calculation to produce a reasonably accurate spectrum. We use water as an example to elucidate the problem.},

Here we show that a simple but long-ranged anisotropy in nanoparticles' interactions can greatly enrich this scenario. In experiments with colloidal Co nanocrystals, which bear a substantial magnetic dipole, we observe assemblies quite distinct from those formed by nonmagnetic particles. Reﬂecting the strongly nonequilibrium nature of this process, nanocrystal aggregates also diﬀer substantially from expected low-energy arrangements. Using coarse-grained computer simulations of dipolar nanoparticles, we have identiﬁed several dynamical mechanisms from which such unusual morphologies can arise. For particles with modest dipole moments, transient connections between growing domains frustrate phase separation into sparse and dense regions on the substrate. Characteristic length scales of the resulting cellular networks depend non-monotonically on the depth of quenches we use to mimic the eﬀects of solvent evaporation. For particles with strong dipole moments, chain-like aggregates formed at early times serve as the agents of assembly at larger scales. Their eﬀective interactions drive the formation of layered loop structures similar to those observed in experiments.},

While backbone motions have long been considered essential for long-range information conveyance, side-chain motions have rarely been considered. In this work, we demonstrate their potential utility using Monte Carlo sampling of side-chain torsional angles on a fixed backbone to quantify correlations amongst side-chain inter-rotameric motions. Results indicate that long-range correlations of side-chain fluctuations can arise independently from several different types of interactions: steric repulsions, implicit solvent interactions, or hydrogen bonding and salt-bridge interactions. These robust correlations persist across the entire protein (up to 60 A˚ in the case of calmodulin) and can propagate long-range changes in side-chain variability in response to single residue perturbations.},

While self-assembly of spherical nanoparticles has advanced signiﬁcantly in the past decade, assembly of rod-shaped nanocrystals has seen limited progress due to the requirement of orientational order. Here, the parameters relevant to self-assembly are systematically quantiﬁed using a combination of diffraction and theoretical modeling; these highlight the importance of kinetics on orientational order. Through drying-mediated self-assembly, we achieve unprecedented control over orientational order (up to 96\% vertically oriented rods on 1 cm2 areas) on a wide range of substrates (ITO, PEDOT:PSS, Si3N4). This opens new avenues for nanocrystal-based devices competitive with thin ﬁlm devices, as problems of granularity can be tackled through crystallographic orientational control over macroscopic areas.},

	abstract = {Self-assembling, light harvesting arrays of organic chromophores can be templated using the tobacco mosaic virus coat protein (TMVP). The efﬁciency of energy transfer within systems containing a high ratio of donors to acceptors shows a strong dependence on the TMVP assembly state. Rod and disk assemblies derived from a single stock of chromophore-labeled protein exhibit drastically different levels of energy transfer, with rods signiﬁcantly outperforming disks. The origin of the superior transfer efﬁciency was probed through the controlled introduction of photoinactive conjugates into the assemblies. The efﬁciency of the rods showed a linear dependence on the proportion of deactivated chromophores, suggesting the availability of redundant energy transfer pathways that can circumvent defect sites. Similar disk-based systems were markedly less efﬁcient at all defect levels. To examine these differences further, the brightness of donor-only systems was measured as a function of defect incorporation. In rod assemblies, the photophysical properties of the donor chromophores showed a signiﬁcant dependence on the number of defects. These differences can be partly attributed to vertical energy transfer events in rods that occur more rapidly than the horizontal transfers in disks. Using these geometries and the previously measured energy transfer rates, computational models were developed to understand this behavior in more detail and to guide the optimization of future systems. These simulations have revealed that signiﬁcant differences in excited state dissipation rates likely also contribute to the greater efﬁciency of the rods and that statistical variations in the assembly process play a more minor role.

	abstract = {Contrary to the expectations from classic theories of ion solvation, spectroscopy and computer simulations of the liquid–vapor interface of aqueous electrolyte solutions suggest that ions little larger than a water molecule can prefer to reside near the liquid's surface. Here we advance the view that such affinity originates in a competition between strong opposing forces, primarily due to volume exclusion and dielectric polarization, that are common to all dense polar liquids. We present evidence for this generic mechanism from computer simulations of (
              i
              ) water and (
              ii
              ) a Stockmayer fluid near its triple point. In both cases, we show that strong surface enhancement of small ions, obtained by tuning solutes' size and charge, can be accentuated or suppressed by modest changes in either of those parameters. Statistics of solvent polarization, when the ion is held at and above the Gibbs dividing surface, highlight a basic deficiency in conventional models of dielectric response, namely, the neglect of interfacial flexibility. By distorting the solution's boundary, an ion experiences fluctuations in electrostatic potential and in electric field whose magnitudes attenuate much more gradually (as the ion is removed from the liquid phase) than for a quiescent planar interface. As one consequence, the collective responses that determine free energies of solvation can resolve very differently in nonuniform environments than in bulk. We show that this persistence of electric-field fluctuations additionally shapes the sensitivity of solute distributions to ion polarizability.},

	abstract = {Knowledge of the mechanical properties of double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) is essential to understand the role of dsDNA looping in gene regulation and the mechanochemistry of molecular machines that operate on dsDNA. Here, we use a newly developed tool, force sensors with optical readout, to measure the forces inside short, strained loops composed of both dsDNA and single-stranded DNA. By varying the length of the loops and their proportion of dsDNA, it was possible to vary their internal forces from 1 pN to .20 pN. Surprisingly, internal loop forces changed erratically as the amount of dsDNA was increased for a given loop length, with the effect most notable in the smallest loop (57 nucleotides). Monte Carlo simulations based on the helical wormlike chain model accurately predict internal forces when more than half of the loop is dsDNA but fail otherwise. Mismatches engineered into the double-stranded regions increased ﬂexibility, suggesting that Watson-Crick basepaired dsDNA can withstand high compressive forces without recourse to multibase melts. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy further excluded transient melting (microsecond to millisecond duration) as a mechanism for relief of compressive forces in the tested dsDNAs. DNA loops with integrated force sensors may allow the comprehensive mapping of the elasticity of short dsDNAs as a function of both sequence and salt.},

Increasing RH at constant temperature results in both disorder-to-order and order-to-order transitions. In-situ small-angle neutron scattering experiments on the open block copolymer system, when combined with water uptake measurement, indicate that the disorder-to-order transition is driven by an increase in the partial molar entropy of the water molecules in the ordered phase relative to that in the disordered phase. This is in contrast to most systems wherein increasing entropy results in stabilization of the disordered phase.},

	abstract = {When pulled along its axis, double-stranded DNA elongates abruptly at a force of ;65 pN. Two physical pictures have been developed to describe this overstretched state. The ﬁrst proposes that strong forces induce a phase transition to a molten state consisting of unhybridized single strands. The second picture introduces an elongated hybridized phase called S-DNA. Little thermodynamic evidence exists to discriminate directly between these competing pictures. Here we show that within a microscopic model of DNA we can distinguish between the dynamics associated with each. In experiment, considerable hysteresis in a cycle of stretching and shortening develops as temperature is increased. Since there are few possible causes of hysteresis in a system whose extent is appreciable in only one dimension, such behavior offers a discriminating test of the two pictures of overstretching. Most experiments are performed upon nicked DNA, permitting the detachment (unpeeling) of strands. We show that the long-wavelength progression of the unpeeled front generates hysteresis, the character of which agrees with experiment only if we assume the existence of S-DNA. We also show that internal melting can generate hysteresis, the degree of which depends upon the nonextensive loop entropy of single-stranded DNA.},

	abstract = {Sum frequency generation (SFG) vibrational spectroscopy has been used to characterize the interfacial structure of a series of model peptides at the hydrophobic polystyrene–buffer interface. The peptides contain two types of amino acids, one hydrophobic (X) and one hydrophilic (Y). Their sequences are Ac-XYYXXYXXYYXXYX-NH2 (XY14) and Ac-XYXYXYX-NH2 (XY7), respectively, where the X and Y combinations are: leucine (L) and lysine (K); alanine (A) and lysine (K); alanine (A) and arginine (R); and phenylalanine (F) and arginine (R), respectively. One additional peptide was synthesized and characterized, AcLKKLLKL-NH2, referred to as LK7 α. The XY14 peptides showed SFG spectra that were characteristic of the hydrophobic (X) amino acid of the peptide. Comparison with the 7-amino acid peptides shows that the molecular orientation of alanine is more sensitive to changes in sequence and chain length than leucine or phenylalanine. The hydrophilic amino acids are not observed in the SFG spectra of these peptides at the hydrophobic polystyrene interface (with the possible exception of the AR7 peptide), suggesting the hydrophilic amino acids studied here have a random orientation at this interface. The results of these studies are put into the context of recent SFG studies of proteins adsorbed onto hydrophobic surfaces. Furthermore, our approach to theoretical understanding of interfacial peptide structure is outlined. The results of a molecular dynamics simulation of the LK14 peptide on a hydrophobic interface are presented and discussed.},

The rapidity of polymer translocation (∼30 000 bp/ms) in this geometry greatly limits the information that can be obtained for each base. Here we show that the translocation speed of λ-DNA through artificial nanopores can be reduced using optical tweezers. DNAs coupled to optically trapped beads were presented to nanopores. DNAs initially placed up to several micrometers from the pore could be captured. Subsequently, the optical tweezers reduced translocation speeds to 150 bp/ms, about 200-fold slower than free DNA. Moreover, the optical tweezers allowed us to “floss” single polymers back and forth through the pore. The combination of controlled sample presentation, greatly slowed translocation speeds, and repeated electrophoresis of single DNAs removes several barriers to using artificial nanopores for sequencing, haplotyping, and characterization of protein−DNA interactions.},

The range of temperature accessible to aqueous solutions at ambient pressure is sufficiently small that such insensitivity would appear in experiments as an isosbestic point. This mechanism depends only on the continuity of equilibrium distributions, not on the presence of multiple components. Even the simplest model of a single solute species in a fluctuating environment exhibits isosbestic points, van’t Hoff behavior, and, with appropriate dependence of transition frequency on configuration, multiple absorption peaks.},

	abstract = {Although it is widely accepted that the local structure of liquid water has tetrahedral arrangements of molecules ordered by hydrogen bonds, the mechanism by which water molecules switch hydrogen-bonded partners remains unclear. In this mechanism, the role of nonhydrogen-bonded configurations (NHBs) between adjacent molecules is of particular importance. A molecule may switch hydrogen-bonding partners either (
              i
              ) through thermally activated breaking of a hydrogen bond that creates a dangling hydrogen bond before finding a new partner or (
              ii
              ) by infrequent but rapid switching events in which the NHB is a transition state. Here, we report a combination of femtosecond 2D IR spectroscopy and molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the stability of NHB species in an isotopically dilute mixture of HOD in D
              2
              O. Measured 2D IR spectra reveal that hydrogen-bonded configurations and NHBs undergo qualitatively different relaxation dynamics, with NHBs returning to hydrogen-bonded frequencies on the time scale of water's fastest intermolecular motions. Simulations of an atomistic model for the OH vibrational spectroscopy of water yield qualitatively similar 2D IR spectra to those measured experimentally. Analysis of NHBs in simulations by quenching demonstrates that the vast majority of NHBs are in fact part of a hydrogen-bonded well of attraction and that virtually all molecules return to a hydrogen-bonding partner within 200 fs. The results from experiment and simulation demonstrate that NHBs are intrinsically unstable and that dangling hydrogen bonds are an insignificant species in liquid water.},

	abstract = {The unique chemical and physical properties of liquid water are a direct result of its highly directional hydrogen-bond (HB) network structure and associated dynamics. However, despite intense experimental and theoretical scrutiny spanning more than four decades, a coherent description of this HB network remains elusive. The essential question of whether continuum or multicomponent (“intact,” “broken bond,” etc.) models best describe the HB interactions in liquid water has engendered particularly intense discussion. Most notably, the temperature dependence of water's Raman spectrum has long been considered to be among the strongest evidence for a multicomponent distribution. Using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, we show here that many of the features of the Raman spectrum that are considered to be hallmarks of a multistate system, including the asymmetric band profile, the isosbestic (temperature invariant) point, and van't Hoff behavior, actually result from a continuous distribution. Furthermore, the excellent agreement between our newly remeasured Raman spectra and our model system further supports the locally tetrahedral description of liquid water, which has recently been called into question [Wernet, P.,

Using replica mean-field theory, we determine phase diagrams for stress-induced unfolding of typical random sequences. This transition is sharp in the limit of infinitely long chain molecules. However, for chain lengths relevant to biological macromolecules, partially unfolded conformations prevail over an intermediate range of stress. These necklacelike structures, comprised of alternating compact and extended subunits, are stabilized by quenched variations in the composition of finite chain segments. The most stable arrangements of these subunits are largely determined by preferential extension of segments rich in solvophilic monomers. This predicted significance of necklace structures explains recent observations in protein stretching experiments. We examine the statistical features of select sequences that give rise to mechanical strength and may thus have guided the evolution of proteins that carry out mechanical functions in living cells.},

At relatively high densities, the active hard spheres can form a dynamic crystalline bridge, which induces a strong oscillating long range dynamic wetting repulsion between the walls. With decreasing density, the dynamic bridge gradually breaks, and an intriguing long range dynamic depletion attraction arises.

            Optimizing parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) is the leading approach to make use of near-term quantum computers. However, very little is known about the cost function landscape for PQCs, which hinders progress towards quantum-aware optimizers. In this work, we investigate the connection between three different landscape features that have been observed for PQCs: (1) exponentially vanishing gradients (called barren plateaus (BPs)), (2) exponential cost concentration about the mean, and (3) the exponential narrowness of minima (called narrow gorges). We analytically prove that these three phenomena occur together, i.e., when one occurs then so do the other two. A key implication of this result is that one can numerically diagnose BPs via cost differences rather than via the computationally more expensive gradients. More broadly, our work shows that quantum mechanics rules out certain cost landscapes (which otherwise would be mathematically possible), and hence our results could be interesting from a quantum foundations perspective.},

	abstract = {We consider neural networks with a single hidden layer and non- decreasing positively homogeneous activation functions like the rectified linear units. By letting the number of hidden units grow unbounded and using classical non-Euclidean regularization tools on the output weights, they lead to a convex optimization problem and we provide a detailed theoretical analysis of their generalization performance, with a study of both the approximation and the estimation errors. We show in particular that they are adaptive to unknown underlying linear structures, such as the dependence on the projection of the input variables onto a low-dimensional subspace. Moreover, when using sparsity- inducing norms on the input weights, we show that high- dimensional non-linear variable selection may be achieved, without any strong assumption regarding the data and with a total number of variables potentially exponential in the number of observations. However, solving this convex optimization problem in infinite dimensions is only possible if the non- convex subproblem of addition of a new unit can be solved efficiently. We provide a simple geometric interpretation for our choice of activation functions and describe simple conditions for convex relaxations of the finite-dimensional non- convex subproblem to achieve the same generalization error bounds, even when constant-factor approximations cannot be found. We were not able to find strong enough convex relaxations to obtain provably polynomial-time algorithms and leave open the existence or non-existence of such tractable algorithms with non-exponential sample complexities.},

Our main result is a continuity bound for the von Neumann entropy with respect to the proposed distance, which significantly strengthens the best continuity bound with respect to the trace distance. We also propose a generalization of the Lipschitz constant to quantum observables. The notion of quantum Lipschitz constant allows us to compute the proposed distance with a semidefinite program. We prove a quantum version of Marton's transportation inequality and a quantum Gaussian concentration inequality for the spectrum of quantum Lipschitz observables. Moreover, we derive bounds on the contraction coefficients of shallow quantum circuits and of the tensor product of one-qudit quantum channels with respect to the proposed distance.

	abstract = {Thermodynamics serves as a universal means for studying physical systems from an energy perspective. In recent years, with the establishment of the field of stochastic and quantum thermodynamics, the ideas of thermodynamics have been generalized to small fluctuating systems. Independently developed in mathematics and statistics, the optimal transport theory concerns the means by which one can optimally transport a source distribution to a target distribution, deriving a useful metric between probability distributions, called the Wasserstein distance. Despite their seemingly unrelated nature, an intimate connection between these fields has been unveiled in the context of continuous-state Langevin dynamics, providing several important implications for nonequilibrium systems. In this study, we elucidate an analogous connection for discrete cases by developing a thermodynamic framework for discrete optimal transport. We first introduce a novel quantity called dynamical state mobility, which significantly improves the thermodynamic uncertainty relation and provides insights into the precision of currents in nonequilibrium Markov jump processes. We then derive variational formulas that connect the discrete Wasserstein distances to stochastic and quantum thermodynamics of discrete Markovian dynamics described by master equations. Specifically, we rigorously prove that the Wasserstein distance equals the minimum product of irreversible entropy production and dynamical state mobility over all admissible Markovian dynamics. These formulas not only unify the relationship between thermodynamics and the optimal transport theory for discrete and continuous cases but also generalize it to the quantum case. In addition, we demonstrate that the obtained variational formulas lead to remarkable applications in stochastic and quantum thermodynamics.},

Based on this interpretation, we obtain a thermodynamic trade-off relation between transition time and the entropy production. This thermodynamic trade-off relation is regarded as a thermodynamic speed limit which gives a tighter bound of the entropy production. We also discuss stochastic thermodynamics for the subsystem and derive a lower bound on the partial entropy production as a generalization of the second law of information thermodynamics. Our formalism also provides a geometric picture of the optimal protocol to minimize the entropy production. We illustrate these results by the optimal stochastic heat engine and show a geometrical bound of the efficiency.},

	abstract = {We refer as ‘Langevin–Kramers’ dynamics to a class of stochastic differential systems exhibiting a degenerate ‘metriplectic’ structure. This means that the drift field can be decomposed into a symplectic and a gradient-like component with respect to a pseudo-metric tensor associated with random fluctuations affecting increments of only a sub-set of the degrees of freedom. Systems in this class are often encountered in applications as elementary models of Hamiltonian dynamics in a heat bath eventually relaxing to a Boltzmann steady state. Entropy production control in Langevin–Kramers models differs from the now well-understood case of Langevin–Smoluchowski dynamics for two reasons. First, the definition of entropy production stemming from fluctuation theorems specifies a cost functional which does not act coercively on all degrees of freedom of control protocols. Second, the presence of a symplectic structure imposes a non-local constraint on the class of admissible controls. Using Pontryagin control theory and restricting the attention to additive noise, we show that smooth protocols attaining extremal values of the entropy production appear generically in continuous parametric families as a consequence of a trade-off between smoothness of the admissible protocols and non-coercivity of the cost functional. Uniqueness is, however, always recovered in the over-damped limit as extremal equations reduce at leading order to the Monge–Ampère–Kantorovich optimal mass-transport equations.},

	abstract = {Using a double-well potential as a physical memory, we study with experiments and numerical simulations the energy exchanges during erasure processes, and model quantitatively the cost of fast operation. Within the stochastic thermodynamics framework we find the origins of the overhead to Landauer’s bound required for fast operations: in the overdamped regime this term mainly comes from the dissipation, while in the underdamped regime it stems from the heating of the memory. Indeed, the system is thermalized with its environment at all times during quasistatic protocols, but for fast ones, the inefficient heat transfer to the thermostat is delayed with respect to the work influx, resulting in a transient temperature rise. The warming, quantitatively described by a comprehensive statistical physics description of the erasure process, is noticeable on both the kinetic and potential energy: they no longer comply with equipartition. The mean work and heat to erase the information therefore increase accordingly. They are both bounded by an effective Landauer’s limit kBTeffln2, where Teff is a weighted average of the actual temperature of the memory during the process.},

These successes evince an ability to accurately represent high-dimensional functions, but rigorous results about the approximation error of neural networks after training are few. Here we establish conditions for global convergence of the standard optimization algorithm used in machine learning applications, stochastic gradient descent (SGD), and quantifying the scaling of its error with the size of the network. This is done by reinterpreting SGD as the evolution of a particle system with interactions governed by a potential related to the objective or “loss” function used to train the network. We show that, when the number n of units is large, the empirical distribution of the particles descends on a convex landscape towards the global minimum at a rate independent of n, with a resulting approximation error that universally scales as O(n−1). These properties are established in the form of a law of large numbers and a central limit theorem for the empirical distribution. Our analysis also quantifies the scale and nature of the noise introduced by SGD and provides guidelines for the step size and batch size to use when training a neural network. We illustrate our findings on examples in which we train neural networks to learn the energy function of the continuous 3-spin model on the sphere.

An enrichment of PLD within the condensed phase gives rise to formation, on longer time scales, of amyloid-like ﬁbrils (aging). In this study, we employ coarse-grained Langevin dynamics simulations to explore the physical basis for the structural diversity in condensed phases of multi-domain RBPs. We discovered a highly cooperative ﬁrst-order transition between disordered structures and an ordered phase whereby chains of PLD organize in ﬁbrils with high nematic orientational order. An interplay between homodomain (PLDPLD) and heterodomain (PLD-RBD) interactions results in variety of structures with distinct spatial architectures. Interestingly, the different structural phases also exhibit vastly different intracluster dynamics of proteins, with diffusion coefﬁcients 5 times (disordered structures) to 50 times (ordered structures) lower than that of the dilute phase. Cooperativity of this liquid-solid transition makes ﬁbril formation highly malleable to mutations or post-translational modiﬁcations. Our results provide a mechanistic understanding of how multi-domain RBPs could form assemblies with distinct structural and material properties.},

	abstract = {A central object in the computational studies of rare events is the committor function. Though costly to compute, the committor function encodes complete mechanistic information of the processes involving rare events, including reaction rates and transition-state ensembles. Under the framework of transition path theory (TPT), recent work [1] proposes an algorithm where a feedback loop couples a neural network that models the committor function with importance sampling, mainly umbrella sampling, which collects data needed for adaptive training. In this work, we show additional modifications are needed to improve the accuracy of the algorithm. The first modification adds elements of supervised learning, which allows the neural network to improve its prediction by fitting to sample-mean estimates of committor values obtained from short molecular dynamics trajectories. The second modification replaces the committor-based umbrella sampling with the finite-temperature string (FTS) method, which enables homogeneous sampling in regions where transition pathways are located. We test our modifications on low-dimensional systems with non-convex potential energy where reference solutions can be found via analytical or the finite element methods, and show how combining supervised learning and the FTS method yields accurate computation of committor functions and reaction rates. We also provide an error analysis for algorithms that use the FTS method, using which reaction rates can be accurately estimated during training with a small number of samples.},

Exploiting the repriorisation, we develop a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior sampling algorithm which mixes faster the wider the BNN. This contrasts with the typically poor performance of MCMC in high dimensions. We observe up to 50x higher effective sample size relative to no reparametrisation for both fully-connected and residual networks. Improvements are achieved at all widths, with the margin between reparametrised and standard BNNs growing with layer width.},

            Recurrent neural networks have led to breakthroughs in natural language processing and speech recognition. Here we show that recurrent networks, specifically long short-term memory networks can also capture the temporal evolution of chemical/biophysical trajectories. Our character-level language model learns a probabilistic model of 1-dimensional stochastic trajectories generated from higher-dimensional dynamics. The model captures Boltzmann statistics and also reproduces kinetics across a spectrum of timescales. We demonstrate how training the long short-term memory network is equivalent to learning a path entropy, and that its embedding layer, instead of representing contextual meaning of characters, here exhibits a nontrivial connectivity between different metastable states in the underlying physical system. We demonstrate our model’s reliability through different benchmark systems and a force spectroscopy trajectory for multi-state riboswitch. We anticipate that our work represents a stepping stone in the understanding and use of recurrent neural networks for understanding the dynamics of complex stochastic molecular systems.},

Often one wishes to supplement the experimentally observed dynamics with prior knowledge or intuition about the system. While the recurrent nature of these networks allows them to model arbitrarily long memories in the time series used in training, it makes it harder to impose prior knowledge or intuition through generic constraints. In this work, we present a path sampling approach based on principle of Maximum Caliber that allows us to include generic thermodynamic or kinetic constraints into recurrent neural networks. We show the method here for a widely used type of recurrent neural network known as long short-term memory network in the context of supplementing time series collected from different application domains. These include classical Molecular Dynamics of a protein and Monte Carlo simulations of an open quantum system continuously losing photons to the environment and displaying Rabi oscillations. Our method can be easily generalized to other generative artificial intelligence models and to generic time series in different areas of physical and social sciences, where one wishes to supplement limited data with intuition or theory based corrections.},

	abstract = {Freidlin-Wentzell theory of large deviations for the description of the effect of small random perturbations on dynamical systems is exploited as a numerical tool. Speciﬁcally, a numerical algorithm is proposed to compute the quasipotential in the theory, which is the key object to quantify the dynamics on long time scales when the effect of the noise becomes ubiquitous: the equilibrium distribution of the system, the pathways of transition between metastable states and their rate, etc., can all be expressed in terms of the quasi-potential. We propose an algorithm to compute these quantities called the geometric minimum action method (gMAM), which is a blend of the original minimum action method (MAM) and the string method. It is based on a reformulation of the large deviations action functional on the space of curves that allows one to easily perform the double minimization of the original action required to compute the quasi-potential. The theoretical background of the gMAM in the context of large deviations theory is discussed in detail, as well as the algorithmic aspects of the method. The gMAM is then illustrated on several examples: a ﬁnite-dimensional system displaying bistability and modeled by a nongradient stochastic ordinary differential equation, an inﬁnite-dimensional analogue of this system modeled by a stochastic partial differential equation, and an example of a bistable genetic switch modeled by a Markov jump process. c 2007 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

            Nanostructured, responsive hydrogels formed due to electrostatic interactions have promise for applications such as drug delivery and tissue mimics. These physically cross-linked hydrogels are composed of an aqueous solution of oppositely charged triblocks with charged end-blocks and neutral, hydrophilic mid-blocks. Due to their electrostatic interactions, the end-blocks microphase separate and form physical cross-links that are bridged by the mid-blocks. The structure of this system was determined using a new, efficient embedded fluctuation (EF) model in conjunction with self-consistent field theory. The calculations using the EF model were validated against unapproximated field-theoretic simulations with complex Langevin sampling and were found consistent with small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) measurements on an experimental system. Using both the EF model and SAXS, phase diagrams were generated as a function of end-block fraction and polymer concentration. Several structures were observed including a body-centered cubic sphere phase, a hexagonally packed cylinder phase, and a lamellar phase. Finally, the EF model was used to explore how parameters that directly relate to polymer chemistry can be tuned to modify the resulting phase diagram, which is of practical interest for the development of new hydrogels.},

              Oppositely charged polyelectrolytes can undergo a macroscopic, associative phase separation in solution,
              via
              a process known as complex coacervation. Significant recent effort has gone into providing a clear, physical picture of coacervation; most work has focused on improving the field theory picture that emerged from the classical Voorn–Overbeek theory. These methods have persistent issues, however, resolving the molecular features that have been shown to play a major role in coacervate thermodynamics. In this paper, we outline a theoretical approach to coacervation based on a transfer matrix formalism that is an alternative to traditional field-based approaches. We develop theoretical arguments informed by experimental observation and simulation, which serve to establish an analytical expression for polymeric complex coacervation that is consistent with the molecular features of coacervate phases. The analytical expression provided by this theory is in a form that can be incorporated into more complicated theoretical or simulation formalisms, and thus provides a starting point for understanding coacervate-driven self-assembly or biophysics.},

We combine numerical results with linear response theory and variational estimates of these effective interactions, giving the ﬁrst insights into such interactions in a many-body system, across a wide range of biases. The system exhibits a hierarchy of responses to the bias, remaining quasi-equilibrated on short length scales, but deviating far from equilibrium on large length scales. We discuss the connection between this hierarchy and the hierarchical ageing behaviour of the system.},

These mechanically responsive molecules change color or become fluorescent upon application of a mechanical stimulus as they undergo a chemical reaction when a load is applied. By incorporating MPs such as spirolactam, spiropyran, or dianthracene into a material system, the real-time stress distribution of the matrix can be directly observed through a visual response, ideal for damage and failure sensing applications. A wide array of applications that require continuous structural health monitoring could benefit from MPs including flexible electronics, protective coatings, and polymer matrix composites. However, there are significant technical challenges preventing MP implementation in industry. Effective strategies to quantitatively calibrate the photo response of the MP with applied stress magnitudes must be developed. Additionally, environmental conditions, including temperature, humidity, and ultraviolet light exposure can potentially impact the performance of MPs. By addressing these limitations, engineers can work to move MPs from the synthetic chemistry bench to the field. This review aims to highlight recent progress in MP research, discuss barriers to implementation, and provide an outlook on the future of MPs, specifically focused on polymeric material systems. Although the focus is on engineering MPs for bulk materials, a brief overview of mechanochemistry will be discussed followed by methods for activation and quantification of MP photo response (concentrating specifically on fluorescently active species).

	abstract = {Force can induce remarkable non-destructive transformations along a polymer, but we have a limited understanding of the energy transduction and product distribution in tandem mechanochemical reactions. Ladderanes consist of multiple fused cyclobutane rings and have recently been used as monomeric motifs to develop polymers that drastically change their properties in response to force. Here we show that [4]-ladderane always exhibits ‘all-or-none’ cascade mechanoactivations and the same stereochemical distribution of the generated dienes under various conditions and within different polymer backbones. Transition state theory fails to capture the reaction kinetics and explain the observed stereochemical distributions. Ab initio steered molecular dynamics reveals unique non-equilibrium dynamic effects: energy transduction from the first cycloreversion substantially accelerates the second cycloreversion, and bifurcation on the force-modified potential energy surface leads to the product distributions. Our findings illustrate the rich chemistry in closely coupled multi-mechanophores and an exciting potential for effective energy transduction in tandem mechanochemical reactions. The mechanochemical activation of [4]-ladderane/ene has been studied and found to exhibit cascade unzipping and a consistent stereochemical distribution of products under various conditions and in different polymer backbones. Ab initio steered molecular dynamics simulations revealed unique non-equilibrium dynamic effects in the mechanochemistry of ladderane, cascade activation and reaction pathway bifurcation.},

	abstract = {Intermediate ﬁlament (IF) proteins assemble into highly ﬂexible ﬁlaments that organize into complex cytoplasmic networks: keratins in all types of epithelia, vimentin in endothelia, and desmin in muscle. Since IF elongation proceeds via endto-end annealing of unit-length ﬁlaments and successively of progressively growing ﬁlaments, it is important to know how their remarkable ﬂexibility, i.e., their persistence length lp, inﬂuences the assembly kinetics. In fact, their lp ranges between 0.3 mm (keratin K8/K18) and 1.0 mm (vimentin and desmin), and thus is orders of magnitude lower than that of microtubules and F-actin. Here, we present a unique mathematical model, which implements the semiﬂexible nature of the three IF types based on published semiﬂexible polymers theories and depends on a single free parameter k0. Calibrating this model to ﬁlament mean length dynamics of the three proteins, we demonstrate that the persistence length is indeed essential to accurately describe their assembly kinetics. Furthermore, we reveal that the difference in ﬂexibility alone does not explain the signiﬁcantly faster assembly rate of keratin ﬁlaments compared with that of vimentin. Likewise, desmin assembles approximately six times faster than vimentin, even though both their ﬁlaments exhibit the same lp value. These data strongly indicate that differences in their individual amino acid sequences signiﬁcantly impact the assembly rates. Nevertheless, using a single k0 value for each of these three key representatives of the IF protein family, our advanced model does accurately describe the length distribution and mean length dynamics and provides effective ﬁlament assembly rates. It thus provides a tool for future investigations on the impact of posttranslational modiﬁcations or amino acid changes of IF proteins on assembly kinetics. This is an important issue, as the discovery of mutations in IF genes causing severe human disease, particularly for desmin and keratins, is steadily increasing.},

We have determined the atomic structure of the capsid of Sulfolobus monocaudavirus 1, a virus that infects hosts living in nearly boiling acid. A highly hydrophobic protein, likely integrated into the host membrane before the virions assemble, forms 7 strands that slide past each other in both the tails and the spindle body. We observe the discrete steps that occur as the tail tubes expand, and these are due to highly conserved quasiequivalent interactions with neighboring subunits maintained despite signiﬁcant diameter changes. Our results show how helical assemblies can vary their diameters, becoming nearly spherical to package a larger genome and suggest how all spindle-shaped viruses have evolved from archaeal rod-like viruses.},

Analysis shows that the different theoretical formulations are consistent, clarifying the significance of the inherent microscopic lag-times that are implicated, and that the most meaningful one-dimensional reaction coordinate in the region of the transition state is along the gradient of the committor in the multidimensional subspace of collective variables. It is shown that the familiar reactive flux activated dynamics formalism provides an effective route to calculate the transition rate in the case of a narrow sharp barrier but much less so in the case of a broad flat barrier. In this case, the standard reactive flux correlation function decays very slowly to the plateau value that corresponds to the transmission coefficient. Treating the committor function as a reaction coordinate does not alleviate all issues caused by the slow relaxation of the reactive flux correlation function. A more efficient activated dynamics simulation algorithm may be achieved from a modified reactive flux weighted by the committor. Simulation results on simple systems are used to illustrate the various conceptual points.},

	abstract = {The kinetics of a dynamical system comprising two metastable states is formulated in terms of a finite-time propagator in phase space (position and velocity) adapted to the underdamped Langevin equation. Dimensionality reduction to a subspace of collective variables yields familiar expressions for the propagator, committor, and steady-state flux. A quadratic expression for the steady-state flux between the two metastable states can serve as a robust variational principle to determine an optimal approximate committor expressed in terms of a set of collective variables. The theoretical formulation is exploited to clarify the foundation of the string method with swarms-of-trajectories, which relies on the mean drift of short trajectories to determine the optimal transition pathway. It is argued that the conditions for Markovity within a subspace of collective variables may not be satisfied with an arbitrary short time-step and that proper kinetic behaviors appear only when considering the effective propagator for longer lag times. The effective propagator with finite lag time is amenable to an eigenvalue-eigenvector spectral analysis, as elaborated previously in the context of position-based Markov models. The time-correlation functions calculated by swarms-of-trajectories along the string pathway constitutes a natural extension of these developments. The present formulation provides a powerful theoretical framework to characterize the optimal pathway between two metastable states of a system.},

Here, we present a general framework for calculating these dynamical quantities by approximating boundary value problems using dynamical operators with a Galerkin expansion. A speciﬁc choice of basis set in the expansion corresponds to the estimation of dynamical quantities using a Markov state model. More generally, the boundary conditions impose restrictions on the choice of basis sets. We demonstrate how an alternative basis can be constructed using ideas from diffusion maps. In our numerical experiments, this basis gives results of comparable or better accuracy to Markov state models. Additionally, we show that delay embedding can reduce the information lost when projecting the system’s dynamics for model construction; this improves estimates of dynamical statistics considerably over the standard practice of increasing the lag time.},

	abstract = {Near equilibrium, Green-Kubo relations provide microscopic expressions for macroscopic transport coefficients in terms of equilibrium correlation functions. At their core, they are based on the intimate relationship between response and fluctuations as embodied by the equilibrium fluctuation-dissipation theorem, a connection generically broken far from equilibrium. In this paper, we identify a class of perturbations whose response around far-from-equilibrium steady states is linked to steady-state correlation functions via an equilibrium-like fluctuation-response equality. We then utilize this prediction to substantiate linearized hydrodynamic transport equations that describe how spatial inhomogeneities in macroscopic nonequilibrium systems relax. As a consequence, we derive nonequilibrium Green-Kubo relations for the transport coefficients of two types of hydrodynamic variables: local conserved densities and broken-symmetry modes. A by-product of this work is to provide a theoretical foundation for the validity of Onsager's regression hypothesis around nonequilibrium steady states. Our predictions are analytically and numerically corroborated for two model systems: density diffusion in a fluid of soft, spherical active Brownian particles and phase diffusion in the noisy Kuramoto model on a square lattice.},

For a broad class of potentials, we construct a time discrete, iterative variational scheme whose solutions converge to the solution of the Fokker–Planck equation. The major novelty of this iterative scheme is that the time-step is governed by the Wasserstein metric on probability measures. This formulation enables us to reveal an appealing, and previously unexplored, relationship between the Fokker–Planck equation and the associated free energy functional.

In this paper, we aim to reduce the generalization error without spending more time in generating training samples. However, to reduce the generalization error, the regression network needs to be ﬁt on a large number of training samples (e.g., a collection of potential-ground state pairs). The training samples can be produced by running numerical solvers, which takes much time in many applications. In this paper, we aim to reduce the generalization error without spending more time in generating training samples. Inspired by few-shot learning techniques, we develop the Multi-Level Fine-Tuning algorithm by introducing levels of training: we ﬁrst train the regression network on samples generated at the coarsest grid and then successively ﬁne-tune the network on samples generated at ﬁner grids. Within the same amount of time, numerical solvers generate more samples on coarse grids than on ﬁne grids. We demonstrate a signiﬁcant reduction of generalization error in numerical experiments on challenging problems with oscillations, discontinuities, or rough coeﬃcients. Further analysis can be conducted in the Neural Tangent Kernel regime and we provide practical estimators to the generalization error. The number of training samples at diﬀerent levels can be optimized for the smallest estimated generalization error under the constraint of budget for training data. The optimized distribution of budget over levels provides practical guidance with theoretical insight as in the celebrated Multi-Level Monte Carlo algorithm.},

	abstract = {The developmental dynamics of multicellular organisms is a process that takes place in a multi-stable system in which each attractor state represents a cell type, and attractor transitions correspond to cell differentiation paths. This new understanding has revived the idea of a quasi-potential landscape, first proposed by Waddington as a metaphor. To describe development, one is interested in the ‘relative stabilities’ of N attractors (N {\textgreater} 2). Existing theories of state transition between local minima on some potential landscape deal with the exit part in the transition between two attractors in pair-attractor systems but do not offer the notion of a global potential function that relates more than two attractors to each other. Several ad hoc methods have been used in systems biology to compute a landscape in non-gradient systems, such as gene regulatory networks. Here we present an overview of currently available methods, discuss their limitations and propose a new decomposition of vector fields that permits the computation of a quasi-potential function that is equivalent to the Freidlin–Wentzell potential but is not limited to two attractors. Several examples of decomposition are given, and the significance of such a quasi-potential function is discussed.},

Our single model with 165 million parameters, achieves 27.5 BLEU onEnglish-to-German translation, improving over the existing best ensemble result by over 1 BLEU.

We consider trajectories that are conditioned to transition between regions of configuration space in finite time, such as those relevant in the study of reactive events, and trajectories exhibiting rare fluctuations of time-integrated quantities in the long time limit, such as those relevant in the calculation of large deviation functions. In both cases, reinforcement learning techniques are used to optimize an added force that minimizes the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the conditioned trajectory ensemble and a driven one. Under the optimized added force, the system evolves the rare fluctuation as a typical one, affording a variational estimate of its likelihood in the original trajectory ensemble. Low variance gradients employing value functions are proposed to increase the convergence of the optimal force. The method we develop employing these gradients leads to efficient and accurate estimates of both the optimal force and the likelihood of the rare event for a variety of model systems.},

We show here that this driven process can be represented in two other ways: ﬁrst, as a process satisfying various variational principles involving large deviation functions and relative entropies and, second, as an optimal stochastic control process minimizing a cost function also related to large deviation functions. These interpretations of the driven process generalize and unify many previous results on maximum entropy approaches to nonequilibrium systems, spectral characterizations of positive operators, and control approaches to large deviation theory. They also lead, as brieﬂy discussed, to new methods for analytically or numerically approximating large deviation functions.},

	abstract = {The precise stacking of different two-dimensional (2D) structures such as graphene and MoS2 has reinvigorated the field of 2D materials, revealing exotic phenomena at their interfaces1,2. These unique interfaces are typically constructed using mechanical or deposition-based methods to build a heterostructure one monolayer at a time2,3. By contrast, self-assembly is a scalable technique, where complex materials can selectively form in solution4–6. Here we show a synthetic strategy for the self-assembly of layered perovskite–non-perovskite heterostructures into large single crystals in aqueous solution. Using bifunctional organic molecules as directing groups, we have isolated six layered heterostructures that form as an interleaving of perovskite slabs with a different inorganic lattice, previously unknown to crystallize with perovskites. In many cases, these intergrown lattices are 2D congeners of canonical inorganic structure types. To our knowledge, these compounds are the first layered perovskite heterostructures formed using organic templates and characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Notably, this interleaving of inorganic structures can markedly transform the band structure. Optical data and first principles calculations show that substantive coupling between perovskite and intergrowth layers leads to new electronic transitions distributed across both sublattices. Given the technological promise of halide perovskites4, this intuitive synthetic route sets a foundation for the directed synthesis of richly structured complex semiconductors that self-assemble in water.},

We report on hydrogels of peptide-DNA conjugates and peptides that organize into superstructures of intertwined filaments that disassemble upon the addition of molecules or changes in charge density. Experiments and simulations demonstrate that this response requires large scale spatial redistribution of molecules directed by strong noncovalent interactions among them. Simulations also suggest that the chemically reversible structures can only occur within a limited range of supramolecular cohesive energies. Storage moduli of the hydrogels change reversibly as superstructures form and disappear, as does the phenotype of neural cells in contact with these materials.},

Our method works for any target distribution speciﬁed by their unnormalized density function, and can train any black-box architectures that are differentiable in terms of the parameters we want to adapt. As an application of our method, we propose an amortized MLE algorithm for training deep energy model, where a neural sampler is adaptively trained to approximate the likelihood function. Our method mimics an adversarial game between the deep energy model and the neural sampler, and obtains realisticlooking images competitive with the state-of-the-art results.},

We show how large deviation theory can be used to explain some properties of the astroids, like their shrinking and sharpening as the number of applied pulses is increased.

Two common conventions, the Ito and the Stratonovich, provide alternative rules for evaluation of the noise, but other conventions are possible. We show that the requirement that a particle’s distribution function approach the Boltzmann distribution at long times dictates that a drift term must be added to the Langevin equation. This drift term is proportional to the derivative of the diffusion coefficient times a factor that depends on the convention used to define the multiplicative noise. We explore the consequences of this result in a number of examples with spatially varying diffusion coefficients. We also derive a path integral representation for arbitrary interpretation of the noise, and use it in a perturbative study of correlations in a simple system.},

	abstract = {We explore the link between deep ensembles and Gaussian processes (GPs) through the lens of the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK): a recent development in understanding the training dynamics of wide neural networks (NNs). Previous work has shown that even in the inﬁnite width limit, when NNs become GPs, there is no GP posterior interpretation to a deep ensemble trained with squared error loss. We introduce a simple modiﬁcation to standard deep ensembles training, through addition of a computationally-tractable, randomised and untrainable function to each ensemble member, that enables a posterior interpretation in the inﬁnite width limit. When ensembled together, our trained NNs give an approximation to a posterior predictive distribution, and we prove that our Bayesian deep ensembles make more conservative predictions than standard deep ensembles in the inﬁnite width limit. Finally, using ﬁnite width NNs we demonstrate that our Bayesian deep ensembles faithfully emulate the analytic posterior predictive when available, and can outperform standard deep ensembles in various out-of-distribution settings, for both regression and classiﬁcation tasks.},

	abstract = {Deep ensembles have been empirically shown to be a promising approach for improving accuracy, uncertainty and out-of-distribution robustness of deep learning models. While deep ensembles were theoretically motivated by the bootstrap, non-bootstrap ensembles trained with just random initialization also perform well in practice, which suggests that there could be other explanations for why deep ensembles work well. Bayesian neural networks, which learn distributions over the parameters of the network, are theoretically well-motivated by Bayesian principles, but do not perform as well as deep ensembles in practice, particularly under dataset shift. One possible explanation for this gap between theory and practice is that popular scalable variational Bayesian methods tend to focus on a single mode, whereas deep ensembles tend to explore diverse modes in function space. We investigate this hypothesis by building on recent work on understanding the loss landscape of neural networks and adding our own exploration to measure the similarity of functions in the space of predictions. Our results show that random initializations explore entirely different modes, while functions along an optimization trajectory or sampled from the subspace thereof cluster within a single mode predictions-wise, while often deviating significantly in the weight space. Developing the concept of the diversity--accuracy plane, we show that the decorrelation power of random initializations is unmatched by popular subspace sampling methods. Finally, we evaluate the relative effects of ensembling, subspace based methods and ensembles of subspace based methods, and the experimental results validate our hypothesis.},

The resulting coacervates can have important biological functions, and the ability to form these assemblies is dictated by the protein’s primary amino acid sequence as well as by the solution conditions. We present a complete phase diagram for the simple coacervation of a polyampholyte intrinsically disordered protein using a ﬁeld-theoretic simulation approach. We show that diﬀerences in the primary amino acid sequence and in the distribution of charged amino acids along the sequence lead to diﬀerences in the phase window for coacervation, with block-charged sequences having a larger coacervation window than sequences with a random patterning of charges. The model also captures how changing solution conditions modiﬁes the phase diagram and can serve to guide experimental studies.},

The past decade has seen major advances in many perception tasks, such as visual object recognition and speech recognition, using deep learning models. For higher-level inference, however, probabilistic graphical models with their Bayesian nature are still more powerful and flexible. In recent years, Bayesian deep learning has emerged as a unified probabilistic framework to tightly integrate deep learning and Bayesian models.1 In this general framework, the perception of text or images using deep learning can boost the performance of higher-level inference and, in turn, the feedback from the inference process is able to enhance the perception of text or images. This survey provides a comprehensive introduction to Bayesian deep learning and reviews its recent applications on recommender systems, topic models, control, and so on. We also discuss the relationship and differences between Bayesian deep learning and other related topics, such as Bayesian treatment of neural networks.},

	abstract = {Machine learning has emerged as an invaluable tool in many research areas. In the present work, we harness this power to predict highly accurate molecular infrared spectra with unprecedented computational efficiency. To account for vibrational anharmonic and dynamical effects – typically neglected by conventional quantum chemistry approaches – we base our machine learning strategy on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. While these simulations are usually extremely time consuming even for small molecules, we overcome these limitations by leveraging the power of a variety of machine learning techniques, not only accelerating simulations by several orders of magnitude, but also greatly extending the size of systems that can be treated. To this end, we develop a molecular dipole moment model based on environment dependent neural network charges and combine it with the neural network potential approach of Behler and Parrinello. Contrary to the prevalent big data philosophy, we are able to obtain very accurate machine learning models for the prediction of infrared spectra based on only a few hundreds of electronic structure reference points. This is made possible through the use of molecular forces during neural network potential training and the introduction of a fully automated sampling scheme. We demonstrate the power of our machine learning approach by applying it to model the infrared spectra of a methanol molecule, n-alkanes containing up to 200 atoms and the protonated alanine tripeptide, which at the same time represents the first application of machine learning techniques to simulate the dynamics of a peptide. In all of these case studies we find an excellent agreement between the infrared spectra predicted via machine learning models and the respective theoretical and experimental spectra.},

	abstract = {A lot of progress has been made in recent years in the development of atomistic potentials using machine learning (ML) techniques. In contrast to most conventional potentials, which are based on physical approximations and simplifications to derive an analytic functional relation between the atomic configuration and the potential-energy, ML potentials rely on simple but very flexible mathematical terms without a direct physical meaning. Instead, in case of ML potentials the topology of the potential-energy surface is “learned” by adjusting a number of parameters with the aim to reproduce a set of reference electronic structure data as accurately as possible. Due to this bias-free construction, they are applicable to a wide range of systems without changes in their functional form, and a very high accuracy close to the underlying first-principles data can be obtained. Neural network potentials (NNPs), which have first been proposed about two decades ago, are an important class of ML potentials. Although the first NNPs have been restricted to small molecules with only a few degrees of freedom, they are now applicable to high-dimensional systems containing thousands of atoms, which enables addressing a variety of problems in chemistry, physics, and materials science. In this tutorial review, the basic ideas of NNPs are presented with a special focus on developing NNPs for high-dimensional condensed systems. A recipe for the construction of these potentials is given and remaining limitations of the method are discussed. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

The proposed algorithm learns from previously visited configurations in a continuous and adaptive manner on-the-fly, and predicts (with chemical accuracy) the energies and atomic forces of a new configuration at a minuscule fraction of the time taken by conventional ab initio methods. Key elements of this new accelerated ab initio MD paradigm include representations of atomic configurations by numerical fingerprints, a learning algorithm to map the fingerprints to the properties, a decision engine that guides the choice of the prediction scheme, and requisite amount of ab initio data. The performance of each aspect of the proposed scheme is critically evaluated for Al in several different chemical environments. This work has enormous implications beyond ab initio MD acceleration.

A batch of points in the minima of this NSDS can be iteratively added into the training set to improve the PES. The configuration space is gradually and globally covered without the need to run classical trajectory (or equivalently molecular dynamics) simulations. Through refitting the available analytical PESs of H3 and OH3 reactive systems, we demonstrate the efficiency and robustness of this new strategy, which enables fast convergence of the reactive PESs with respect to the number of points in terms of quantum scattering probabilities.},

Electron transport may be regulated indirectly by controlling the transfer of excitation energy from the light-harvesting complexes, or it may be more directly regulated by controlling the stoichiometry, localization, and interactions of photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport complexes. Regulation of the extent of linear vs. cyclic electron transport is particularly important for controlling the redox balance of the cell. This review discusses what is known of the regulatory mechanisms and the timescales on which they occur, with particular regard to the structural reorganization needed and the constraints imposed by the limited mobility of membrane-integral proteins in the crowded thylakoid membrane. Switching mechanisms requiring substantial movement of integral thylakoid membrane proteins occur on slower timescales than those that require the movement only of cytoplasmic or extrinsic membrane proteins. This difference is probably due to the restricted diffusion of membrane-integral proteins. Multiple switching mechanisms may be needed to regulate electron transport on different timescales.},

	abstract = {The rapid increase in global energy demand and the need to replace carbon dioxide (CO2)-emitting fossil fuels with renewable sources have driven interest in chemical storage of intermittent solar and wind energy1,2. Particularly attractive is the electrochemical reduction of CO2 to chemical feedstocks, which uses both CO2 and renewable energy3–8. Copper has been the predominant electrocatalyst for this reaction when aiming for more valuable multi-carbon products9–16, and process improvements have been particularly notable when targeting ethylene. However, the energy efficiency and productivity (current density) achieved so far still fall below the values required to produce ethylene at cost-competitive prices. Here we describe Cu-Al electrocatalysts, identified using density functional theory calculations in combination with active machine learning, that efficiently reduce CO2 to ethylene with the highest Faradaic efficiency reported so far. This Faradaic efficiency of over 80 per cent (compared to about 66 per cent for pure Cu) is achieved at a current density of 400 milliamperes per square centimetre (at 1.5 volts versus a reversible hydrogen electrode) and a cathodic-side (half-cell) ethylene power conversion efficiency of 55 ± 2 per cent at 150 milliamperes per square centimetre. We perform computational studies that suggest that the Cu-Al alloys provide multiple sites and surface orientations with near-optimal CO binding for both efficient and selective CO2 reduction17. Furthermore, in situ X-ray absorption measurements reveal that Cu and Al enable a favourable Cu coordination environment that enhances C–C dimerization. These findings illustrate the value of computation and machine learning in guiding the experimental exploration of multi-metallic systems that go beyond the limitations of conventional single-metal electrocatalysts.},

The high computational speed on the one hand and the accuracy comparable to that of density functional theory on another hand make machine learning algorithms efficient for high-throughput screening through chemical and configurational space. However, the machine learning algorithms available in the literature require large training datasets to reach the chemical accuracy and also show large errors for the so-called outliers—the out-of-sample molecules, not well-represented in the training set. In the present paper, we propose a new machine learning algorithm for predicting molecular properties that addresses these two issues: it is based on a local model of interatomic interactions providing high accuracy when trained on relatively small training sets and an active learning algorithm of optimally choosing the training set that significantly reduces the errors for the outliers. We compare our model to the other state-of-the-art algorithms from the literature on the widely used benchmark tests.},

On a data set of carbene singlet–triplet energy splittings, we show that MC-DDFMs are able to achieve near-benchmark performance on systems not used for training with a robust degree of active-space independence. Beyond demonstrating that the density and on-top density hold the information necessary to correct the singlet–triplet energy splittings of multiconfigurational wave functions, this approach shows great promise for the development of functionals for MC-PDFT because corrections to the classical energy appear to be more transferable to types of molecules not included in the training data than corrections to total energies such as those yielded by CASSCF or NEVPT2.},

	abstract = {ConspectusDensity functional theory (DFT) calculations are used in over 40,000 scientific papers each year, in chemistry, materials science, and far beyond. DFT is extremely useful because it is computationally much less expensive than ab initio electronic structure methods and allows systems of considerably larger size to be treated. However, the accuracy of any Kohn–Sham DFT calculation is limited by the approximation chosen for the exchange-correlation (XC) energy. For more than half a century, humans have developed the art of such approximations, using general principles, empirical data, or a combination of both, typically yielding useful results, but with errors well above the chemical accuracy limit (1 kcal/mol). Over the last 15 years, machine learning (ML) has made major breakthroughs in many applications and is now being applied to electronic structure calculations. This recent rise of ML begs the question: Can ML propose or improve density functional approximations? Success could greatly enhance the accuracy and usefulness of DFT calculations without increasing the cost.In this work, we detail efforts in this direction, beginning with an elementary proof of principle from 2012, namely, finding the kinetic energy of several Fermions in a box using kernel ridge regression. This is an example of orbital-free DFT, for which a successful general-purpose scheme could make even DFT calculations run much faster. We trace the development of that work to state-of-the-art molecular dynamics simulations of resorcinol with chemical accuracy. By training on ab initio examples, one bypasses the need to find the XC functional explicitly. We also discuss how the exchange-correlation energy itself can be modeled with such methods, especially for strongly correlated materials. Finally, we show how deep neural networks with differentiable programming can be used to construct accurate density functionals from very few data points by using the Kohn–Sham equations themselves as a regularizer. All these cases show that ML can create approximations of greater accuracy than humans, and is capable of finding approximations that can deal with difficult cases such as strong correlation. However, such ML-designed functionals have not been implemented in standard codes because of one last great challenge: generalization. We discuss how effortlessly human-designed functionals can be applied to a wide range of situations, and how difficult that is for ML.},

            Monte Carlo methods, tools for sampling data from probability distributions, are widely used in the physical sciences, applied mathematics, and Bayesian statistics. Nevertheless, there are many situations in which it is computationally prohibitive to use Monte Carlo due to slow “mixing” between modes of a distribution unless hand-tuned algorithms are used to accelerate the scheme. Machine learning techniques based on generative models offer a compelling alternative to the challenge of designing efficient schemes for a specific system. Here, we formalize Monte Carlo augmented with normalizing flows and show that, with limited prior data and a physically inspired algorithm, we can substantially accelerate sampling with generative models.
          , 
            Many problems in the physical sciences, machine learning, and statistical inference necessitate sampling from a high-dimensional, multimodal probability distribution. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms, the ubiquitous tool for this task, typically rely on random local updates to propagate configurations of a given system in a way that ensures that generated configurations will be distributed according to a target probability distribution asymptotically. In high-dimensional settings with multiple relevant metastable basins, local approaches require either immense computational effort or intricately designed importance sampling strategies to capture information about, for example, the relative populations of such basins. Here, we analyze an adaptive MCMC, which augments MCMC sampling with nonlocal transition kernels parameterized with generative models known as normalizing flows. We focus on a setting where there are no preexisting data, as is commonly the case for problems in which MCMC is used. Our method uses 1) an MCMC strategy that blends local moves obtained from any standard transition kernel with those from a generative model to accelerate the sampling and 2) the data generated this way to adapt the generative model and improve its efficacy in the MCMC algorithm. We provide a theoretical analysis of the convergence properties of this algorithm and investigate numerically its efficiency, in particular in terms of its propensity to equilibrate fast between metastable modes whose rough location is known a priori but respective probability weight is not. We show that our algorithm can sample effectively across large free energy barriers, providing dramatic accelerations relative to traditional MCMC algorithms.},

More importantly, we see that a partially decentralized approach, where we include information about the local environment allows us to better control our system towards some target distribution. We explain this by analyzing our approach as a partially-observed Markov decision process. With a partially decentralized approach, the agent is able to act more presciently, both by preventing the formation of undesirable structures and by better stabilizing target structures as compared to a fully decentralized approach.},

Being an importance sampling based estimator, however, FEP suffers from a severe limitation: the requirement of sufﬁcient overlap between distributions. One strategy to mitigate this problem, called Targeted FEP, uses a high-dimensional mapping in conﬁguration space to increase the overlap of the underlying distributions. Despite its potential, this method has attracted only limited attention due to the formidable challenge of formulating a tractable mapping. Here, we cast Targeted FEP as a machine learning problem in which the mapping is parameterized as a neural network that is optimized so as to increase the overlap. We develop a new model architecture that respects permutational and periodic symmetries often encountered in atomistic simulations and test our method on a fully periodic solvation system. We demonstrate that our method leads to a substantial variance reduction in free energy estimates when compared against baselines, without requiring any additional data.},

	abstract = {Machine learning, and in particular neural network models, have revolutionized fields such as image, text, and speech recognition. Today, many important real-world applications in these areas are driven by neural networks. There are also growing applications in engineering, robotics, medicine, and finance. Despite their immense success in practice, there is limited mathematical understanding of neural networks. This paper illustrates how neural networks can be studied via stochastic analysis and develops approaches for addressing some of the technical challenges which arise. We analyze one-layer neural networks in the asymptotic regime of simultaneously (a) large network sizes and (b) large numbers of stochastic gradient descent training iterations. We rigorously prove that the empirical distribution of the neural network parameters converges to the solution of a nonlinear partial differential equation. This result can be considered a law of large numbers for neural networks. In addition, a consequence of our analysis is that the trained parameters of the neural network asymptotically become independent, a property which is commonly called “propagation of chaos.”},

	abstract = {Active systems evade the rules of equilibrium thermodynamics by constantly dissipating energy at the level of their microscopic components. This energy flux stems from the conversion of a fuel, present in the environment, into sustained individual motion. It can lead to collective effects without any equilibrium equivalent, some of which can be rationalized by using equilibrium tools to recapitulate nonequilibrium transitions. An important challenge is then to delineate systematically to what extent the character of these active transitions is genuinely distinct from equilibrium analogs. We review recent works that use stochastic thermodynamics tools to identify, for active systems, a measure of irreversibility comprising a coarse-grained or informatic entropy production. We describe how this relates to the underlying energy dissipation or thermodynamic entropy production, and how it is influenced by collective behavior. Then, we review the possibility of constructing thermodynamic ensembles out-of-equilibrium, where trajectories are biased toward atypical values of nonequilibrium observables. We show that this is a generic route to discovering unexpected phase transitions in active matter systems, which can also inform their design.

We survey the potential of this approach in the field of molecular simulation, consider its challenges, and discuss its underlying concepts and means of application.

Many subcellular condensed bodies are hierarchically organized into multiple coexisting domains or layers. However, our molecular understanding of the assembly and internal organization of these multicomponent droplets is still incomplete, and rules for the coexistence of condensed phases are lacking. Here, we show that the formation of hierarchically organized multiphase droplets with up to three coexisting layers is a generic phenomenon in mixtures of complex coacervates, which serve as models of chargedriven liquid−liquid phase separated systems. We present simple theoretical guidelines to explain both the hierarchical arrangement and the demixing transition in multiphase droplets using the interfacial tensions and critical salt concentration as inputs. Multiple coacervates can coexist if they diﬀer suﬃciently in macromolecular density, and we show that the associated diﬀerences in critical salt concentration can be used to predict multiphase droplet formation. We also show that the coexisting coacervates present distinct chemical environments that can concentrate guest molecules to diﬀerent extents. Our ﬁndings suggest that condensate immiscibility may be a very general feature in biological systems, which could be exploited to design self-organized synthetic compartments to control biomolecular processes.},

A long-standing design approach uses genetic fusion to join protein homo-oligomer subunits via α-helical linkers to form more complex symmetric assemblies, but this method is hampered by linker flexibility and a dearth of geometric solutions. Here, we describe a general computational method for rigidly fusing homo-oligomer and spacer building blocks to generate user-defined architectures that generates far more geometric solutions than previous approaches. The fusion junctions are then optimized using Rosetta to minimize flexibility. We apply this method to design and test 92 dihedral symmetric protein assemblies using a set of designed homodimers and repeat protein building blocks. Experimental validation by native mass spectrometry, small-angle X-ray scattering, and negative-stain single-particle electron microscopy confirms the assembly states for 11 designs. Most of these assemblies are constructed from designed ankyrin repeat proteins (DARPins), held in place on one end by α-helical fusion and on the other by a designed homodimer interface, and we explored their use for cryogenic electron microscopy (cryo-EM) structure determination by incorporating DARPin variants selected to bind targets of interest. Although the target resolution was limited by preferred orientation effects and small scaffold size, we found that the dual anchoring strategy reduced the flexibility of the target-DARPIN complex with respect to the overall assembly, suggesting that multipoint anchoring of binding domains could contribute to cryo-EM structure determination of small proteins.},

During motility, eukaryotic cells and intracellular pathogens are propelled by actin networks organized by nucleation-promoting factors that trigger the formation of nascent filaments off the side of existing filaments in the network. A Brownian ratchet (BR) mechanism has been proposed to couple actin polymerization to cellular movements, whereby thermal motions are rectified by the addition of actin monomers at the end of growing filaments. Here, by following actin-propelled microspheres using three-dimensional laser tracking, we find that beads adhered to the growing network move via an object-fluctuating BR. Velocity varies with the amplitude of thermal fluctuation and inversely with viscosity as predicted for a BR. In addition, motion is saltatory with a broad distribution of step sizes that is correlated in time. These data point to a model in which thermal fluctuations of the microsphere or entire actin network, and not individual filaments, govern motility. This conclusion is supported by Monte Carlo simulations of an adhesion-based BR and suggests an important role for membrane tension in the control of actin-based cellular protrusions.},

Leveraging time reversibility in the microscopic dynamics, we relate nonlinear response to equilibrium multitime correlation functions among both time reversal symmetric and asymmetric observables, which can be evaluated from derivatives of large deviation functions. This connection establishes a thermodynamiclike relation for nonequilibrium response and provides a practical route to its evaluation, as large deviation functions are amenable to importance sampling.

Recently, since the work of Shore and Johnson, MaxEnt has been regarded as a principle that is broader than either physics or information alone. MaxEnt is a procedure that ensures that inferences drawn from stochastic data satisfy basic self-consistency requirements. The different historical justifications for the entropy S=−∑ipilog pi and its corresponding variational principles are reviewed. As an illustration of the broadening purview of maximum entropy principles, maximum caliber, which is path entropy maximization applied to the trajectories of dynamical systems, is also reviewed. Examples are given in which maximum caliber is used to interpret dynamical fluctuations in biology and on the nanoscale, in single-molecule and few-particle systems such as molecular motors, chemical reactions, biological feedback circuits, and diffusion in microfluidics devices.},

In general, the shear couples to the particles by translational as well as rotational advection, but in the aforementioned case of xy symmetry, only translational advection is relevant in the linear regime. We apply the response formulas analytically in solvable cases and numerically in a speciﬁc setup.

While the mechanical pressure exerted onto confining walls has been linked to correlations between particles' positions and their orientations, we show that these correlations are entirely controlled by boundary effects. We also consider a definition of local pressure, which describes interparticle forces in terms of momentum exchange between different regions of the system. We present three pieces of analytical evidence which indicate that such a local pressure exists, and we show that its bulk value differs from the mechanical pressure exerted on the walls of the system. We attribute this difference to the fact that the local pressure in the bulk does not depend on boundary effects, contrary to the mechanical pressure. We carefully examine these boundary effects using a channel geometry, and we show a virial formula for the pressure correctly predicts the mechanical pressure even in finite channels. However, this result no longer holds in more complex geometries, as exemplified for a channel that includes circular obstacles.},

	abstract = {Engineering subcellular organization in microbes shows great promise in addressing bottlenecks in metabolic engineering efforts; however, rules guiding selection of an organization strategy or platform are lacking. Here, we study compartment morphology as a factor in mediating encapsulated pathway performance. Using the 1,2-propanediol utilization microcompartment (Pdu MCP) system from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2, we find that we can shift the morphology of this protein nanoreactor from polyhedral to tubular by removing vertex protein PduN. Analysis of the metabolic function between these Pdu microtubes (MTs) shows that they provide a diffusional barrier capable of shielding the cytosol from a toxic pathway intermediate, similar to native MCPs. However, kinetic modeling suggests that the different surface area to volume ratios of MCP and MT structures alters encapsulated pathway performance. Finally, we report a microscopy-based assay that permits rapid assessment of Pdu MT formation to enable future engineering efforts on these structures.},

Studies of crystalline shells have shown the importance of the mechanical properties of building units in the shell morphology. However, the mechanism underlying the morphology of multicomponent assemblies is still poorly understood. Here, we analyze multicomponent closed shells that have different mechanical properties. By minimizing elastic energy, we show that heterogeneous bending rigidities regulate the surface pattern into circular, spikes, and ridge shapes. Interestingly, our continuum elasticity model recovers the patterns that have been proposed in bacterial microcompartments (BMCs), which are self-organized protein shells that aid the breakdown of complex molecules and allow bacteria to survive in hostile environments. In addition, our work elucidates the principles of pattern formation that can be used to design and engineer multicomponent microcompartments with a specific surface distribution of the components.},

They are postulated to help bacteria survive in hostile environments. Metabolic engineers are interested in repurposing these organelles for non-native functions. Here, we use computational, theoretical, and experimental approaches to determine mechanisms that effectively control microcompartment self-assembly. We find, via multiscale modeling and mutagenesis studies, the interactions responsible for the binding of hexamer-forming proteins in a model system, the propanediol utilization bacterial microcompartments from Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium LT2. We determine how the changes in the microcompartment hexamer protein preferred angles and interaction strengths can modify the assembled morphologies. We demonstrate that such altered strengths and angles are achieved via amino acid mutations. A thermodynamic model provides guidelines to design microcompartments of various morphologies. These findings yield insight in controlled protein assembly and provide principles for assembling microcompartments for biochemical or energy applications as nanoreactors.},

A distinguished physicist's exploration of the question which lies at the heart of biology, it was written for the layman, but proved one of the spurs to the birth of molecular biology and the subsequent discovery of the structure of DNA. The philosopher Karl Popper hailed it as a 'beautiful and important book' by 'a great man to whom I owe a personal debt for many exciting discussions'. It appears here together with Mind and Matter, his essay investigating a relationship which has eluded and puzzled philosophers since the earliest times. Schrodinger asks what place consciousness occupies in the evolution of life, and what part the state of development of the human mind plays in moral questions. Brought together with these two classics are Schrödinger's autobiographical sketches, published and translated here for the first time. They offer a fascinating fragmentary account of his life as a background to his scientific writings, making this volume a valuable additon to the shelves of scientist and layman alike.},

While similar equilibrium problems are tractable using standard thermodynamics, a generalized description for nonequilibrium systems is lacking, making the design problem particularly difficult. Here we show we can exploit the large-deviation behavior of a Brownian particle and design a variety of geometrically complex steady-state density distributions and flux field flows. We achieve this design target from direct knowledge of the joint large-deviation functional for the empirical density and flow, and a “relaxation” algorithm on the desired target states via adjustable force field parameters. We validate the method by replicating analytical results, and demonstrate its capacity to yield complex prescribed targets, such as rose-curve or polygonal shapes on the plane. We consider this dynamical fluctuation approach a first step towards the design of more complex NESS where general frameworks are otherwise still lacking.},

For a variety of physical observables, the long-time limit or steady state solution is needed for the computation of desired physical observables. For inverse design or optimal control of such systems, the common approaches are based on brute-force search strategies. Here, we present a novel methodology, based on automatic differentiation, capable of differentiating the steady state solution with respect to any parameter of the Liouvillian. Our approach has a low memory cost, and is agnostic to the exact algorithm for computing the steady state. We illustrate the advantage of this method by inverse designing the parameters of a quantum heat transfer device that maximizes the heat current and the rectification coefficient. Additionally, we optimize the parameters of various Lindblad operators used in the simulation of energy transfer under natural incoherent light. We also present a sensitivity analysis of the steady state for energy transfer under natural incoherent light as a function of the incoherent-light pumping rate.},

The propanediol utilizing (Pdu) microcompartment contains the reactions for metabolizing 1,2-propanediol in certain enteric bacteria, including \textit{Salmonella}. The Pdu shell is assembled from a few thousand protein subunits of several different types. Here we report the crystal structures of two key shell proteins, PduA and PduT. The crystal structures offer insights into the mechanisms of Pdu microcompartment assembly and molecular transport across the shell. PduA forms a symmetric homohexamer whose central pore appears tailored for facilitating transport of the 1,2-propanediol substrate. PduT is a novel, tandem domain shell protein that assembles as a pseudohexameric homotrimer. Its structure reveals an unexpected site for binding an [Fe-S] cluster at the center of the PduT pore. The location of a metal redox cofactor in the pore of a shell protein suggests a novel mechanism for either transferring redox equivalents across the shell or for regenerating luminal [Fe-S] clusters.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

The approach is based on dynamical ensembles, determined by an action on trajectory space. (Anti)Symmetry under time-reversal separates two complementary contributions in the response, one entropic the other frenetic. Under time-reversal invariance of the unperturbed reference process, only the entropic term is present in the response, giving the standard fluctuation–dissipation relations in equilibrium. For non-equilibrium reference ensembles, the frenetic term contributes essentially and is responsible for new phenomena. We discuss modifications in the Sutherland-Einstein relation, the occurence of negative differential mobilities and the saturation of response. We also indicate how the Einstein relation between noise and friction gets violated for probes coupled to a non-equilibrium environment. We end with some discussion on the situation for quantum phenomena, but the bulk of the text concerns classical mesoscopic (open) systems.

	abstract = {Quantitatively measuring the mechanical properties of soft matter over a wide range of length and time scales, especially if a sample is as complex as typical biological materials, remains challenging. Living cells present a further complication because forces are generated within these nonequilibrium materials that can change material properties. We have here developed high-bandwidth techniques for active one- and two-particle microrheology to tackle these issues. By combining active micromanipulation of probe particles with an optical trap with high-resolution tracking of thermal motions of the very same particles by laser interferometry, we can both measure the mechanical properties of and, at the same time, identify nonequilibrium forces in soft materials. In both simple liquids and equilibrium cytoskeletal actin networks, active microrheology (AMR) proves to be less noise sensitive than and offers extended bandwidth (0.1−100 kHz) compared to passive microrheology (PMR), which merely tracks thermal motions. We confirm high-frequency power-law dynamics in equilibrium actin networks with two-particle AMR and also discuss low-frequency local mechanical response near probe particles which shows up in one-particle AMR. The combination of AMR and PMR allowed us to quantify nonthermal force fluctuations in actin networks driven by myosin motor proteins. Our approach offers a new direct way to investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of living materials.},

By identifying affinities and fluxes, the first and the second law are formulated consistently. In the linear response regime, entropy production becomes a quadratic form in the affinities. Specializing to Lindblad dynamics, we identify the corresponding kinetic coefficients in terms of correlation functions of the unperturbed dynamics. Reciprocity relations follow from symmetries with respect to time reversal. The kinetic coefficients can be split into a classical and a quantum contribution subject to an additional constraint, which follows from a natural detailed balance condition. This constraint implies universal bounds on efficiency and power of quantum heat engines. In particular, we show that Carnot efficiency cannot be reached whenever quantum coherence effects are present, i.e., when the Hamiltonian used for work extraction does not commute with the bare system Hamiltonian. For illustration, we specialize our universal results to a driven two-level system in contact with a heat bath of sinusoidally modulated temperature.},

The second term comes with a new meaning: it is the correlation between the observable and the excess in dynamical activity or reactivity, playing an important role in dynamical fluctuation theory out-of-equilibrium. It appears as a generalized escape rate in the occupation statistics. The resulting response formula holds for all observables and allows direct numerical or experimental evaluation, for example in the discussion of effective temperatures, as it only involves the statistical averaging of explicit quantities, e.g. without needing an expression for the nonequilibrium distribution.

	abstract = {We introduce a general framework for analyzing the thermodynamics of small systems that are driven by both a periodic temperature variation and some external parameter modulating their energy. This setup covers, in particular, periodic micro- and nano-heat engines. In a first step, we show how to express total entropy production by properly identified time-independent affinities and currents without making a linear response assumption. In linear response, kinetic coefficients akin to Onsager coefficients can be identified. Specializing to a Fokker-Planck-type dynamics, we show that these coefficients can be expressed as a sum of an adiabatic contribution and one reminiscent of a Green-Kubo expression that contains deviations from adiabaticity. Furthermore, we show that the generalized kinetic coefficients fulfill an Onsager-Casimir-type symmetry tracing back to microscopic reversibility. This symmetry allows for nonidentical off-diagonal coefficients if the driving protocols are not symmetric under time reversal. We then derive a novel constraint on the kinetic coefficients that is sharper than the second law and provides an efficiency-dependent bound on power. As one consequence, we can prove that the power vanishes at least linearly when approaching Carnot efficiency. We illustrate our general framework by explicitly working out the paradigmatic case of a Brownian heat engine realized by a colloidal particle in a time-dependent harmonic trap subject to a periodic temperature profile. This case study reveals inter alia that our new general bound on power is asymptotically tight.},

The system takes in a number of NP precursors from which a library of NPs with varying size, surface charge, target ligand density, and drug load is produced in a reproducible manner. We rapidly synthesized 45 different formulations of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)-b-poly(ethylene glycol) NPs of different size and surface composition and screened and ranked the NPs for their ability to evade macrophage uptake in vitro. Comparison of the results to pharmacokinetic studies in vivo in mice revealed a correlation between in vitro screen and in vivo behavior. Next, we selected NP synthesis parameters that resulted in longer blood half-life and used the microfluidic platform to synthesize targeted NPs with varying targeting ligand density (using a model targeting ligand against cancer cells). We screened NPs in vitro against prostate cancer cells as well as macrophages, identifying one formulation that exhibited high uptake by cancer cells yet similar macrophage uptake compared to nontargeted NPs. In vivo, the selected targeted NPs showed a 3.5-fold increase in tumor accumulation in mice compared to nontargeted NPs. The developed microfluidic platform in this work represents a tool that could potentially accelerate the discovery and clinical translation of NPs.},

	title = {Nonasymptotic bounds for suboptimal importance sampling},
	abstract = {Importance sampling is a popular variance reduction method for Monte Carlo estimation, where a notorious question is how to design good proposal distributions. While in most cases optimal (zero-variance) estimators are theoretically possible, in practice only suboptimal proposal distributions are available and it can often be observed numerically that those can reduce statistical performance signiﬁcantly, leading to large relative errors and therefore counteracting the original intention. In this article, we provide nonasymptotic lower and upper bounds on the relative error in importance sampling that depend on the deviation of the actual proposal from optimality, and we thus identify potential robustness issues that importance sampling may have, especially in high dimensions. We focus on path sampling problems for diﬀusion processes, for which generating good proposals comes with additional technical challenges, and we provide numerous numerical examples that support our ﬁndings.},

	abstract = {Annealed importance sampling (AIS) and related algorithms are highly effective tools for marginal likelihood estimation, but are not fully differentiable due to the use of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) correction steps. Differentiability is a desirable property as it would admit the possibility of optimizing marginal likelihood as an objective using gradient-based methods. To this end, we propose a differentiable AIS algorithm by abandoning MH steps, which further unlocks mini-batch computation. We provide a detailed convergence analysis for Bayesian linear regression which goes beyond previous analyses by explicitly accounting for non-perfect transitions. Using this analysis, we prove that our algorithm is consistent in the full-batch setting and provide a sublinear convergence rate. However, we show that the algorithm is inconsistent when mini-batch gradients are used due to a fundamental incompatibility between the goals of last-iterate convergence to the posterior and elimination of the pathwise stochastic error. This result is in stark contrast to our experience with stochastic optimization and stochastic gradient Langevin dynamics, where the effects of gradient noise can be washed out by taking more steps of a smaller size. Our negative result relies crucially on our explicit consideration of convergence to the stationary distribution, and it helps explain the difﬁculty of developing practically effective AIS-like algorithms that exploit mini-batch gradients.},

Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) is one proposed mechanism for membraneless organelle assembly.

The phase behavior of IDPs is sequence dependent, and its investigation through molecular simulations requires protein models that combine computational efficiency with an accurate description of intramolecular and intermolecular interactions. We developed a general coarse-grained model of IDPs, with residue-level detail, based on an extensive set of experimental data on single-chain properties. Ensemble-averaged experimental observables are predicted from molecular simulations, and a data-driven parameter-learning procedure is used to identify the residue-specific model parameters that minimize the discrepancy between predictions and experiments. The model accurately reproduces the experimentally observed conformational propensities of a set of IDPs. Through two-body as well as large-scale molecular simulations, we show that the optimization of the intramolecular interactions results in improved predictions of protein self-association and LLPS.},

	abstract = {Field-theoretic models have been used extensively to study the phase behavior of inhomogeneous polymer melts and solutions, both in self-consistent mean-field calculations and in numerical simulations of the full theory capturing composition fluctuations. The models commonly used can be grouped into two categories, namely, species models and exchange models. Species models involve integrations of functionals that explicitly depend on fields originating both from species density operators and their conjugate chemical potential fields. In contrast, exchange models retain only linear combinations of the chemical potential fields. In the two-component case, development of exchange models has been instrumental in enabling stable complex Langevin (CL) simulations of the full complex-valued theory. No comparable stable CL approach has yet been established for field theories of the species type. Here, we introduce an extension of the exchange model to an arbitrary number of components, namely, the multi-species exchange (MSE) model, which greatly expands the classes of soft material systems that can be accessed by the complex Langevin simulation technique. We demonstrate the stability and accuracy of the MSE-CL sampling approach using numerical simulations of triblock and tetrablock terpolymer melts, and tetrablock quaterpolymer melts. This method should enable studies of a wide range of fluctuation phenomena in multiblock/multi-species polymer blends and composites.},

We further investigate structural properties and show that the model samples are nearly indistinguishable from the ones obtained with molecular dynamics.

However, if we fix a given target state and a set of external control variables, it is not well-understood (i) how to design a protocol to drive the system toward the desired state nor (ii) the cost of persistently perturbing the stationary distribution. In this work, we derive a bound that relates the proximity to the chosen target with the dissipation associated with the external drive, showing that high-dimensional external control can guide systems toward target distribution but with an inevitable cost. Remarkably, the bound holds arbitrarily far from equilibrium. Second, we investigate the performance of deep reinforcement learning algorithms and provide evidence for the realizability of complex protocols that stabilize otherwise inaccessible states of matter.},

	abstract = {This paper is about the problem of learning a stochastic policy for generating an object (like a molecular graph) from a sequence of actions, such that the probability of generating an object is proportional to a given positive reward for that object. Whereas standard return maximization tends to converge to a single return-maximizing sequence, there are cases where we would like to sample a diverse set of high-return solutions. These arise, for example, in black-box function optimization when few rounds are possible, each with large batches of queries, where the batches should be diverse, e.g., in the design of new molecules. One can also see this as a problem of approximately converting an energy function to a generative distribution. While MCMC methods can achieve that, they are expensive and generally only perform local exploration. Instead, training a generative policy amortizes the cost of search during training and yields to fast generation. Using insights from Temporal Difference learning, we propose GFlowNet, based on a view of the generative process as a ﬂow network, making it possible to handle the tricky case where different trajectories can yield the same ﬁnal state, e.g., there are many ways to sequentially add atoms to generate some molecular graph. We cast the set of trajectories as a ﬂow and convert the ﬂow consistency equations into a learning objective, akin to the casting of the Bellman equations into Temporal Difference methods. We prove that any global minimum of the proposed objectives yields a policy which samples from the desired distribution, and demonstrate the improved performance and diversity of GFlowNet on a simple domain where there are many modes to the reward function, and on a molecule synthesis task.},

We further show that the normalizing flow framework furnishes a reference thermodynamic system, very close to the real thermodynamic system under consideration, that is suitable for the well-established free energy perturbation methods to determine accurate free energy of solids.

	abstract = {Machine learning methods have shown promise in predicting molecular properties, and given sufﬁcient training data, machine learning approaches can enable rapid high-throughput virtual screening of large libraries of compounds. Graph-based neural network architectures have emerged in recent years as the most successful approach for predictions based on molecular structure and have consistently achieved the best performance on benchmark quantum chemical datasets. However, these models have typically required optimized 3D structural information for the molecule to achieve the highest accuracy. These 3D geometries are costly to compute for high levels of theory, limiting the applicability and practicality of machine learning methods in high-throughput screening applications. In this study, we present a new database of candidate molecules for organic photovoltaic applications, comprising approximately 91 000 unique chemical structures. Compared to existing datasets, this dataset contains substantially larger molecules (up to 200 atoms) as well as extrapolated properties for long polymer chains. We show that message-passing neural networks trained with and without 3D structural information for these molecules achieve similar accuracy, comparable to state-of-the-art methods on existing benchmark datasets. These results therefore emphasize that for larger molecules with practical applications, near-optimal prediction results can be obtained without using optimized 3D geometry as an input. We further show that learned molecular representations can be leveraged to reduce the training data required to transfer predictions to a new density functional theory functional.},

We propose a new method that estimates the unknown distribution by matching the statistical properties between observed and simulated random processes. We leverage the expressive power of neural networks to approximate the unknown distribution and use a discriminative neural network for computing the statistical discrepancies between the observed and simulated random processes.

            We use a mesoscale-molecular simulation technique known as Multi-Particle Collision Dynamics (MPC) to study the forces acting on a stationary colloid inside a temperature gradient. We compare our measurements of the thermophoretic force to a theoretical prediction based on Onsager's reciprocal relations, assuming that the temperature gradient is constant across the colloid. We find a good agreement between our measurements and theoretical predictions over a wide range of system parameters, even when the condition of uniform gradients is not strictly fulfilled. Our measurements further suggest that the magnitude of the thermophoretic force depends on the hydrodynamic boundary condition at the colloidal surface, thus highlighting the hydrodynamic character of colloidal thermophoresis. We also investigate how fluid advection disturbs the interfacial layer around the colloid and introduce a dimensionless number to quantify the validity of local thermodynamic equilibrium.},

An agent, a stochastic model, propagates a continuous-time Monte Carlo trajectory and receives a reward conditioned upon the values of certain path-extensive quantities. Evolution produces progressively fitter agents, potentially allowing the calculation of a piece of a large-deviation rate function for a particular model and path-extensive quantity. For models with small state spaces, the evolutionary process acts directly on rates, and for models with large state spaces, the process acts on the weights of a neural network that parameterizes the model’s rates. This approach shows how path-extensive physics problems can be considered within a framework widely used in machine learning.},

In all models studied, the bound is weak where collective fluctuations result in long-ranged correlations, which subsequently links the locations of phase transitions to enhanced entropy production fluctuations. We develop a theory for the onset of enhanced fluctuations and relate it to specific phase transitions in active Brownian particles. We also derive optimal control forces that realize the dynamics necessary to tune dissipation and manipulate the system between phases. In so doing, we uncover a general relationship between entropy production and pattern formation in active matter, as well as ways of controlling it.},

The need for UQ is especially acute for neural models, which are becoming increasingly standard yet are challenging to interpret. While several approaches to UQ have been proposed in the literature, there is no clear consensus on the comparative performance of these models. In this paper, we study this question in the context of regression tasks. We systematically evaluate several methods on five regression data sets using multiple complementary performance metrics. Our experiments show that none of the methods we tested is unequivocally superior to all others, and none produces a particularly reliable ranking of errors across multiple data sets. While we believe that these results show that existing UQ methods are not sufficient for all common use cases and further research is needed, we conclude with a practical recommendation as to which existing techniques seem to perform well relative to others.},

For an individual protein searching for its partner, however, the perspective is quite different: The functional task is challenged by a dense crowd of nonpartners obstructing the way. Adding to the challenge, there is little information about how to navigate the search, since the encountered surrounding is composed of protein surfaces that are predominantly “nonconserved” or, at least, highly variable across organisms. In this study, we demonstrate from a colloidal standpoint that such a blindfolded intracellular search is indeed favored and has more fundamental impact on the cellular organization than previously anticipated. Basically, the unique polyion composition of cellular systems renders the electrostatic interactions different from those in physiological buffer, leading to a situation where the protein net-charge density balances the attractive dispersion force and surface heterogeneity at close range. Inspection of naturally occurring proteomes and in-cell NMR data show further that the “nonconserved” protein surfaces are by no means passive but chemically biased to varying degree of net-negative repulsion across organisms. Finally, this electrostatic control explains how protein crowding is spontaneously maintained at a constant level through the intracellular osmotic pressure and leads to the prediction that the “extreme” in halophilic adaptation is not the ionic-liquid conditions per se but the evolutionary barrier of crossing its physicochemical boundaries.},

However, the search space is vast and efﬁcient exploration is desirable when using reinforcement learning agents. In this study, we propose an algorithm to aid efﬁcient exploration. The algorithm is inspired by a concept known in the literature as curiosity. We show on three benchmarks that a curious agent ﬁnds better performing molecules. This indicates an exciting new research direction for reinforcement learning agents that can explore the chemical space out of their own motivation.

Together with a value network trained from reinforcement learning and a solvent-prediction neural network, our algorithm is comparable to the best MCTS variant (PUCT, similar to Google's Alpha Go) in finding valid synthesis pathways within a fixed searching time, and superior in identifying shorter routes with greener solvents under the same search conditions. In addition, with the same root compound visit count, our algorithm outperforms the PUCT MCTS by 16\% in terms of determining successful routes. Overall the success rate is improved by 19.7\% compared to the upper confidence bound applied to trees (UCT) MCTS method. Moreover, we improve 71.4\% of the routes proposed by the PUCT MCTS variant in pathway length and choices of green solvents. The approach generally enables including Green Chemistry considerations in computer aided synthesis planning with potential applications in process development for fine chemicals or pharmaceuticals.},

However, many such functions cannot be implemented by any master equation, even approximately, which raises the question of how they can occur in the real world. Here we show how any function over some “visible” states can be implemented with master equation dynamics—if the dynamics exploits additional, “hidden” states at intermediate times. We also show that any master equation implementing a function can be decomposed into a sequence of “hidden” timesteps, demarcated by changes in what state-to-state transitions have nonzero probability. In many real-world situations there is a cost both for more hidden states and for more hidden timesteps. Accordingly, we derive a “space–time” tradeoff between the number of hidden states and the number of hidden timesteps needed to implement any given function.},

This lower bound depends on two factors: the undriven probability current in the equilibrium state and the distance from thermal equilibrium of the target distribution. By showing the consequences of this result in a few simple examples, we suggest general implications for the required energetic costs of macromolecular repair and cytosolic protein localization.},

The interplay of components can give rise to complex behavior, which can often be explained using a simple model of the system’s constituent parts. In this work, we introduce the neural relational inference (NRI) model: an unsupervised model that learns to infer interactions while simultaneously learning the dynamics purely from observational data. Our model takes the form of a variational auto-encoder, in which the latent code represents the underlying interaction graph and the reconstruction is based on graph neural networks. In experiments on simulated physical systems, we show that our NRI model can accurately recover ground-truth interactions in an unsupervised manner. We further demonstrate that we can ﬁnd an interpretable structure and predict complex dynamics in real motion capture and sports tracking data.},

	abstract = {Stochastic thermodynamics as reviewed here systematically provides a framework for extending the notions of classical thermodynamics such as work, heat and entropy production to the level of individual trajectories of well-defined non-equilibrium ensembles. It applies whenever a non-equilibrium process is still coupled to one (or several) heat bath(s) of constant temperature. Paradigmatic systems are single colloidal particles in time-dependent laser traps, polymers in external flow, enzymes and molecular motors in single molecule assays, small biochemical networks and thermoelectric devices involving single electron transport. For such systems, a first-law like energy balance can be identified along fluctuating trajectories. For a basic Markovian dynamics implemented either on the continuum level with Langevin equations or on a discrete set of states as a master equation, thermodynamic consistency imposes a local-detailed balance constraint on noise and rates, respectively. Various integral and detailed fluctuation theorems, which are derived here in a unifying approach from one master theorem, constrain the probability distributions for work, heat and entropy production depending on the nature of the system and the choice of non-equilibrium conditions. For non-equilibrium steady states, particularly strong results hold like a generalized fluctuation–dissipation theorem involving entropy production. Ramifications and applications of these concepts include optimal driving between specified states in finite time, the role of measurement-based feedback processes and the relation between dissipation and irreversibility. Efficiency and, in particular, efficiency at maximum power can be discussed systematically beyond the linear response regime for two classes of molecular machines, isothermal ones such as molecular motors, and heat engines such as thermoelectric devices, using a common framework based on a cycle decomposition of entropy production.},

This new extended heat theorem holds true for arbitrary driving and does not require assumptions of local or close to equilibrium.

This computational model captured the syntax of molecular representation in terms of SMILES strings with close to perfect accuracy. The learned pattern probabilities can be used for de novo SMILES generation. This molecular design concept eliminates the need for virtual compound library enumeration. By employing transfer learning, we fine-tuned the RNN′s predictions for specific molecular targets. This approach enables virtual compound design without requiring secondary or external activity prediction, which could introduce error or unwanted bias. The results obtained advocate this generative RNN-LSTM system for high-impact use cases, such as low-data drug discovery, fragment based molecular design, and hit-to-lead optimization for diverse drug targets.},

	abstract = {Standard value function approaches to finding policies for Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) are generally considered to be intractable for large models. The intractability of these algorithms is to a large extent a consequence of computing an exact, optimal policy over the entire belief space.  However, in real-world POMDP problems, computing the optimal policy for the full belief space is often unnecessary for good control even for problems with complicated policy classes. The beliefs experienced by the controller often lie near a structured, low-dimensional subspace embedded in the high-dimensional belief space. Finding a good approximation to the optimal value function for only this subspace can be much easier than computing the full value function.   We introduce a new method for solving large-scale POMDPs by reducing the dimensionality of the belief space. We use Exponential family Principal Components Analysis (Collins, Dasgupta \& Schapire, 2002) to represent sparse, high-dimensional belief spaces using small sets of learned features of the belief state. We then plan only in terms of the low-dimensional belief features. By planning in this low-dimensional space, we can find policies for POMDP models that are orders of magnitude larger than models that can be handled by conventional techniques.  We demonstrate the use of this algorithm on a synthetic problem and on mobile robot navigation tasks.},

	abstract = {Multiagent systems are rapidly finding applications in a variety of domains, including robotics, distributed control, telecommunications, and economics. The complexity of many tasks arising in these domains makes them difficult to solve with preprogrammed agent behaviors. The agents must, instead, discover a solution on their own, using learning. A significant part of the research on multiagent learning concerns reinforcement learning techniques. This paper provides a comprehensive survey of multiagent reinforcement learning (MARL). A central issue in the field is the formal statement of the multiagent learning goal. Different viewpoints on this issue have led to the proposal of many different goals, among which two focal points can be distinguished: stability of the agents' learning dynamics, and adaptation to the changing behavior of the other agents. The MARL algorithms described in the literature aim—either explicitly or implicitly—at one of these two goals or at a combination of both, in a fully cooperative, fully competitive, or more general setting. A representative selection of these algorithms is discussed in detail in this paper, together with the specific issues that arise in each category. Additionally, the benefits and challenges of MARL are described along with some of the problem domains where the MARL techniques have been applied. Finally, an outlook for the field is provided.},

	abstract = {Despite great progress in simulating multiphysics problems using the numerical discretization of partial differential equations (PDEs), one still cannot seamlessly incorporate noisy data into existing algorithms, mesh generation remains complex, and high-d imensional problems governed by parameterized PDEs cannot be tackled. Moreover, solving inverse problems with hidden physics is often prohibitively expensive and requires different formulations and elaborate computer codes. Machine learning has emerged as a promising alternative, but training deep neural networks requires big data, not always available for scientific problems. Instead, such networks can be trained from additional information obtained by enforcing the physical laws (for example, at random points in the continuous space-t ime domain). Such physics-informed learning integrates (noisy) data and mathematical models, and implements them through neural networks or other kernel-b ased regression networks. Moreover, it may be possible to design specialized network architectures that automatically satisfy some of the physical invariants for better accuracy, faster training and improved generalization. Here, we review some of the prevailing trends in embedding physics into machine learning, present some of the current capabilities and limitations and discuss diverse applications of physics-informed learning both for forward and inverse problems, including discovering hidden physics and tackling high-d imensional problems.},

	abstract = {Using conservation of energy—a fundamental property of closed classical and quantum mechanical systems—we develop an efficient gradient-domain machine learning (GDML) approach to construct accurate molecular force fields using a restricted number of samples from ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) trajectories. The GDML implementation is able to reproduce global potential energy surfaces of intermediate-sized molecules with an accuracy of 0.3 kcal mol−1 for energies and 1 kcal mol−1 Å̊−1 for atomic forces using only 1000 conformational geometries for training. We demonstrate this accuracy for AIMD trajectories of molecules, including benzene, toluene, naphthalene, ethanol, uracil, and aspirin. The challenge of constructing conservative force fields is accomplished in our work by learning in a Hilbert space of vector-valued functions that obey the law of energy conservation. The GDML approach enables quantitative molecular dynamics simulations for molecules at a fraction of cost of explicit AIMD calculations, thereby allowing the construction of efficient force fields with the accuracy and transferability of high-level ab initio methods.
The law of energy conservation is used to develop an efficient machine learning approach to construct accurate force fields.

Here we present the deep learning architecture SchNet that is specifically designed to model atomistic systems by making use of continuous-filter convolutional layers. We demonstrate the capabilities of SchNet by accurately predicting a range of properties across chemical space for molecules and materials, where our model learns chemically plausible embeddings of atom types across the periodic table. Finally, we employ SchNet to predict potential-energy surfaces and energy-conserving force fields for molecular dynamics simulations of small molecules and perform an exemplary study on the quantum-mechanical properties of C20-fullerene that would have been infeasible with regular ab initio molecular dynamics.},

Our results show that the latent space preserves chemical similarity principle and thus can be used for the generation of analogue structures. Furthermore, the latent space created by autoencoders were searched systematically to generate novel compounds with predicted activity against dopamine receptor type 2 and compounds similar to known active compounds not included in the trainings set were identified.},

The ENN library e3nn has customizable convolutions, which can be designed to depend only on distances between points, or also on angular features, making them rotationally invariant, or equivariant, respectively. This paper studies the practical value of including angular dependencies for molecular property prediction directly via an ablation study with e3nn and the QM9 data set. We ﬁnd that, for ﬁxed network depth and parameter count, adding angular features decreased test error by an average of 23\%. Meanwhile, increasing network depth decreased test error by only 4\% on average, implying that rotationally equivariant layers are comparatively parameter efﬁcient. We present an explanation of the accuracy improvement on the dipole moment, the target which beneﬁted most from the introduction of angular features.},

Prediction is made by aggregating (majority vote or averaging) the predictions of the ensemble. We built predictive models for six cheminformatics data sets. Our analysis demonstrates that Random Forest is a powerful tool capable of delivering performance that is among the most accurate methods to date. We also present three additional features of Random Forest:  built-in performance assessment, a measure of relative importance of descriptors, and a measure of compound similarity that is weighted by the relative importance of descriptors. It is the combination of relatively high prediction accuracy and its collection of desired features that makes Random Forest uniquely suited for modeling in cheminformatics.},

The filtering removes outliers from both the target function and the inputs of the neural network. The filtering is soft in that some outliers are neither completely rejected nor accepted. To show the need for robust recurrent networks, we compare the predictive ability of least squares estimated recurrent networks on synthetic data and on the Puget Power Electric Demand time series. These investigations result in a class of recurrent neural networks, NARMA(p,q), which show advantages over feedforward neural networks for time series with a moving average component. Conventional least squares methods of fitting NARMA(p,q) neural network models are shown to suffer a lack of robustness towards outliers. This sensitivity to outliers is demonstrated on both the synthetic and real data sets. Filtering the Puget Power Electric Demand time series is shown to automatically remove the outliers due to holidays. Neural networks trained on filtered data are then shown to give better predictions than neural networks trained on unfiltered time series.{\textless}{\textgreater}},

	abstract = {There is an increasing demand for computing the relevant structures, equilibria, and long-timescale kinetics of biomolecular processes, such as protein-drug binding, from high-throughput molecular dynamics simulations. Current methods employ transformation of simulated coordinates into structural features, dimension reduction, clustering the dimension-reduced data, and estimation of a Markov state model or related model of the interconversion rates between molecular structures. This handcrafted approach demands a substantial amount of modeling expertise, as poor decisions at any step will lead to large modeling errors. Here we employ the variational approach for Markov processes (VAMP) to develop a deep learning framework for molecular kinetics using neural networks, dubbed VAMPnets. A VAMPnet encodes the entire mapping from molecular coordinates to Markov states, thus combining the whole data processing pipeline in a single end-to-end framework. Our method performs equally or better than state-of-the-art Markov modeling methods and provides easily interpretable few-state kinetic models.},

            A molecule’s geometry, also known as conformation, is one of a molecule’s most important properties, determining the reactions it participates in, the bonds it forms, and the interactions it has with other molecules. Conventional conformation generation methods minimize hand-designed molecular force field energy functions that are often not well correlated with the true energy function of a molecule observed in nature. They generate geometrically diverse sets of conformations, some of which are very similar to the lowest-energy conformations and others of which are very different. In this paper, we propose a conditional deep generative graph neural network that learns an energy function by directly learning to generate molecular conformations that are energetically favorable and more likely to be observed experimentally in data-driven manner. On three large-scale datasets containing small molecules, we show that our method generates a set of conformations that on average is far more likely to be close to the corresponding reference conformations than are those obtained from conventional force field methods. Our method maintains geometrical diversity by generating conformations that are not too similar to each other, and is also computationally faster. We also show that our method can be used to provide initial coordinates for conventional force field methods. On one of the evaluated datasets we show that this combination allows us to combine the best of both methods, yielding generated conformations that are on average close to reference conformations with some very similar to reference conformations.},

As a proof of principle, the model is first trained to generate molecules that do not contain sulphur. As a second example, the model is trained to generate analogues to the drug Celecoxib, a technique that could be used for scaffold hopping or library expansion starting from a single molecule. Finally, when tuning the model towards generating compounds predicted to be active against the dopamine receptor type 2, the model generates structures of which more than 95\% are predicted to be active, including experimentally confirmed actives that have not been included in either the generative model nor the activity prediction model.},

Still, only a fraction of existing metabolites and their spectral fingerprints are known. Computer-Assisted Structure Elucidation (CASE) of biological metabolites will be an important tool to leverage this lack of knowledge. Indispensable for CASE are modules to predict spectra for hypothetical structures. This paper evaluates different statistical and machine learning methods to perform predictions of proton NMR spectra based on data from our open database NMRShiftDB.
Results: A mean absolute error of 0.18 ppm was achieved for the prediction of proton NMR shifts ranging from 0 to 11 ppm. Random forest, J48 decision tree and support vector machines achieved similar overall errors. HOSE codes being a notably simple method achieved a comparatively good result of 0.17 ppm mean absolute error.
Conclusion: NMR prediction methods applied in the course of this work delivered precise predictions which can serve as a building block for Computer-Assisted Structure Elucidation for biological metabolites.},

Since very few mean ﬁeld games have explicit or semi-explicit solutions, numerical simulations play a crucial role in obtaining quantitative information from this class of models. They may lead to systems of evolutive partial diﬀerential equations coupling a backward Bellman equation and a forward Fokker-Planck equation. In the present survey, we focus on such systems. The forward-backward structure is an important feature of this system, which makes it necessary to design unusual strategies for mathematical analysis and numerical approximation. In this survey, several aspects of a ﬁnite diﬀerence method used to approximate the previously mentioned system of PDEs are discussed, including convergence, variational aspects and algorithms for solving the resulting systems of nonlinear equations. Finally, we discuss in details two applications of mean ﬁeld games to the study of crowd motion and to macroeconomics, a comparison with mean ﬁeld type control, and present numerical simulations.},

The theory is discussed from an original viewpoint. It is shown how to compute exactly the mean frequency of transition between two predefined sets which either partition phase space (as in TST) or are taken to be well-separated metastable sets corresponding to long-lived conformation states (as necessary to obtain the actual transition rate constants between these states). Exact and approximate criterions for the optimal TST dividing surface with minimum recrossing rate are derived. Some issues about the definition and meaning of the free energy in the context of TST are also discussed. Finally precise error estimates for the numerical procedure to evaluate the transmission coefficient κS of the TST dividing surface are given, and it is shown that the relative error on κS scales as 1∕
√
κS
 when κS is small. This implies that dynamical corrections to the TST rate constant can be computed efficiently if and only if the TST dividing surface has a transmission coefficient κS which is not too small. In particular, the TST dividing surface must be optimized upon (for otherwise κS is generally very small), but this may not be sufficient to make the procedure numerically efficient (because the optimal dividing surface has maximum κS, but this coefficient may still be very small).},

We briefly review Hochreiter's (1991) analysis of this problem, then address it by introducing a novel, efficient, gradient based method called long short-term memory (LSTM). Truncating the gradient where this does not do harm, LSTM can learn to bridge minimal time lags in excess of 1000 discrete-time steps by enforcing constant error flow through constant error carousels within special units. Multiplicative gate units learn to open and close access to the constant error flow. LSTM is local in space and time; its computational complexity per time step and weight is O. 1. Our experiments with artificial data involve local, distributed, real-valued, and noisy pattern representations. In comparisons with real-time recurrent learning, back propagation through time, recurrent cascade correlation, Elman nets, and neural sequence chunking, LSTM leads to many more successful runs, and learns much faster. LSTM also solves complex, artificial long-time-lag tasks that have never been solved by previous recurrent network algorithms.},

	abstract = {The last decade has witnessed an experimental revolution in data science and machine learning, epitomised by deep learning methods. Indeed, many high-dimensional learning tasks previously thought to be beyond reach -- such as computer vision, playing Go, or protein folding -- are in fact feasible with appropriate computational scale. Remarkably, the essence of deep learning is built from two simple algorithmic principles: first, the notion of representation or feature learning, whereby adapted, often hierarchical, features capture the appropriate notion of regularity for each task, and second, learning by local gradient-descent type methods, typically implemented as backpropagation. While learning generic functions in high dimensions is a cursed estimation problem, most tasks of interest are not generic, and come with essential pre-defined regularities arising from the underlying low-dimensionality and structure of the physical world. This text is concerned with exposing these regularities through unified geometric principles that can be applied throughout a wide spectrum of applications. Such a 'geometric unification' endeavour, in the spirit of Felix Klein's Erlangen Program, serves a dual purpose: on one hand, it provides a common mathematical framework to study the most successful neural network architectures, such as CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers. On the other hand, it gives a constructive procedure to incorporate prior physical knowledge into neural architectures and provide principled way to build future architectures yet to be invented.},

              Protein structures can provide invaluable information, both for reasoning about biological processes and for enabling interventions such as structure-based drug development or targeted mutagenesis. After decades of effort, 17\% of the total residues in human protein sequences are covered by an experimentally determined structure

              . Here we markedly expand the structural coverage of the proteome by applying the state-of-the-art machine learning method, AlphaFold
              2
              , at a scale that covers almost the entire human proteome (98.5\% of human proteins). The resulting dataset covers 58\% of residues with a confident prediction, of which a subset (36\% of all residues) have very high confidence. We introduce several metrics developed by building on the AlphaFold model and use them to interpret the dataset, identifying strong multi-domain predictions as well as regions that are likely to be disordered. Finally, we provide some case studies to illustrate how high-quality predictions could be used to generate biological hypotheses. We are making our predictions freely available to the community and anticipate that routine large-scale and high-accuracy structure prediction will become an important tool that will allow new questions to be addressed from a structural perspective.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2108.06916},
	abstract = {For many non-equilibrium dynamics driven by small noise, in physics, chemistry, biology, or economy, rare events do matter. Large deviation theory then explains that the leading order term of the main statistical quantities have an exponential behavior. The exponential rate is often obtained as the inﬁmum of an action, which is minimized along an instanton. In this paper, we consider the computation of the next order sub-exponential prefactors, which are crucial for a large number of applications. Following a path integral approach, we derive the dynamics of the Gaussian ﬂuctuations around the instanton and compute from it the sub-exponential prefactors. As might be expected, the formalism leads to the computation of functional determinants and matrix Riccati equations. By contrast with the cases of equilibrium dynamics with detailed balance or generalized detailed balance, we stress the speciﬁc non locality of the solutions of the Riccati equation: the prefactors depend on ﬂuctuations all along the instanton and not just at its starting and ending points. We explain how to numerically compute the prefactors. The case of statistically stationary quantities requires considerations of non trivial initial conditions for the matrix Riccati equation.},

	abstract = {The incorporation of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes into a block copolymer system can lead to formation of microphase separated nanostructures driven by the electrostatic complex between two oppositely charged blocks. It is a theoretical challenge to build an appropriate model to handle such coacervate-driven self-assembly, which should capture the strong electrostatic correlations for highly charged polymers. In this paper, we develop the self-consistent field theory considering the ion paring effect to predict the phase behavior of block polyelectrolytes. In our model, two types of ion pairs, the binding between two oppositely charged monomers and the binding between charged monomers and counterions, are included. Their strength of formation is controlled by two parameters Kaa and Kac, respectively. We give a detailed analysis about how the binding strength Kac and Kaa and salt concentration affect the self-assembled nanostructure of diblock polyelectrolyte systems. The results show that the binding between two oppositely charged blocks provides driven force for microphase separation, while the binding between charged monomers and counterions competes with the polyion pairing and thus suppresses the microphase separation. The addition of salt has a shielding effect on the charges of polymers, which is a disadvantage to microphase separation. The phase diagrams as a function of polymer concentration and salt concentration at different situations are constructed, and the influence of Kaa, Kac, and charged block composition fa is analyzed in depth. The obtained phase diagrams are in good agreement with currently existing experimental and theoretical results.},

To understand better the structure/property relationships governing polymeric gene delivery, we synthesized polymers with 70 different primary structures, at 6 to 12 different molecular weights, using monomers previously identified as common to effective gene delivery polymers. This library was characterized by (1) molecular weight, (2) particle size upon complexation with DNA, (3) surface charge upon complexation with DNA, (4) optimal polymer/DNA ratio, and (5) transfection efficiency. In this library, polymers with 20 of the 70 primary structures possess transfection efficiencies as good as or better than one of the best commercially available lipid reagents, Lipofectamine 2000. In general, the most effective polymers condense DNA into sub-150-nm complexes with positive surface charge. Among this group, the 2 most effective polymers condensed DNA to the smallest particle sizes (71 and 79 nm). Interestingly, the top 9 polymers were all formed from amino alcohols, and the structure of the 3 top performing polymers differs by only one carbon. This convergence in structure of the top performing polymers suggests a common mode of action and provides a framework with which future polymers can be designed.},

To further investigate this, we designed a series of studies to systematically change LNP particle size without altering lipid composition and evaluated biophysical properties and immunogenicity of the resulting LNPs.

The mathematical formulation of the bandgap optimization problem leads to an infinite-dimensional Hermitian eigenvalue optimization problem parametrized by the dielectric material and the wave vector. To make the problem tractable, the original eigenvalue problem is discretized using the finite element method into a series of finite-dimensional eigenvalue problems for multiple values of the wave vector parameter. The resulting optimization problem is large-scale and non-convex, with low regularity and non-differentiable objective. By restricting to appropriate eigenspaces, we reduce the large-scale non-convex optimization problem via reparametrization to a sequence of small-scale convex semidefinite programs (SDPs) for which modern SDP solvers can be efficiently applied. Numerical results are presented for both transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarizations at several frequency bands. The optimized structures exhibit patterns which go far beyond typical physical intuition on periodic media design.},

Often, it is computationally intractable to resolve the finest features in the solution. The only recourse is to use approximate coarse-grained representations, which aim to accurately represent long-wavelength dynamics while properly accounting for unresolved small-scale physics. Deriving such coarse-grained equations is notoriously difficult and often ad hoc. Here we introduce data-driven discretization, a method for learning optimized approximations to PDEs based on actual solutions to the known underlying equations. Our approach uses neural networks to estimate spatial derivatives, which are optimized end to end to best satisfy the equations on a low-resolution grid. The resulting numerical methods are remarkably accurate, allowing us to integrate in time a collection of nonlinear equations in 1 spatial dimension at resolutions 4× to 8× coarser than is possible with standard finite-difference methods.},

As cell density increases, individual cells retain the same stiffness-dependent differences unless they are very close or in molecular contact. On nonlinear strain-stiffening fibrin gels, the same cell types become maximally spread even when the low strain elastic modulus would predict a round morphology, and cells are influenced by the presence of neighbors hundreds of microns away. Time lapse microscopy reveals that fibroblasts and human mesenchymal stem cells on fibrin deform the substrate by several microns up to five cell lengths away from their plasma membrane through a force limited mechanism. Atomic force microscopy and rheology confirm that these strains locally and globally stiffen the gel, depending on cell density, and this effect leads to long distance cell-cell communication and alignment. Thus cells are acutely responsive to the nonlinear elasticity of their substrates and can manipulate this rheological property to induce patterning.},

The advantage of this approach is that all important physical effects, such as polymer chain stretching, conformational entropy changes near an interface, enthalpic terms, etc., as well as the connectedness of the blocks of the copolymer, are automatically taken into account. In order to simplify the theory we calculate the inhomogeneous contribution to the free energy, as well as the polymer distribution functions, in a perturbation scheme (Landau-Ginzburg expansion), assuming that the density fluctuations of the components are small in comparison with their average values. This approach is valid near the spinodal for microphase separation and is less reliable as the inhomogeneous free-energy term grows in magnitude. For simplicity the ordered phase is assumed to have a lamellar structure, so that the third-order term in the expansion of the free energy vanishes. The temperature-composition phase diagrams for styrene-butadiene copolymer mixed with either polystyrene or polybutadiene homopolymer are calculated as an example for a series of chain lengths. The curvature of the phase boundaries near eutectic or critical points is discussed in detail. The assumption of a lamellar structure restricts the direct transition between the mesophase and the homogeneous phase to second order, resulting in the coalescence of some binodal lines in the phase diagrams. The maximum solubility of the homopolymer in the ordered phase is found to be large (up to 30\% w/w) but to decrease rapidly els the homopolymer molecular weight is increased. The condition for homopolymer-induced mesophase formation is found to be ZH/ZC {\textgreater} l/t for a symmetric copolymer and a selective homopolymer with degrees of polymerization Zc and ZH, respectively. A computer program for evaluating the phase diagrams is available as supplementary material.},

We provide separation results between probability metrics with ﬁxed-kernel and feature-learning discriminators using the function classes F2 and F1 respectively, which were developed to study overparametrized twolayer neural networks. In particular, we construct pairs of distributions over hyper-spheres that can not be discriminated by ﬁxed kernel (F2) integral probability metric (IPM) and Stein discrepancy (SD) in high dimensions, but that can be discriminated by their feature learning (F1) counterparts. To further study the separation we provide links between the F1 and F2 IPMs with sliced Wasserstein distances. Our work suggests that ﬁxed-kernel discriminators perform worse than their feature learning counterparts because their corresponding metrics are weaker.},

Mean field theory predicts that the core radii scale primarily with the degree of polymerization of the B block as with α ≃ 2/3 or larger, and this is consistent with many experimental data. However, recent experiments on very strongly segregated “crew-cut” micelles indicate a much weaker dependence. In this paper, we study crew-cut micelles using a simple mean field theory and Monte Carlo simulations. The Monte Carlo simulations include the calculation of the system relaxation times, which are used both to determine the simulation times required to reach equilibrium and to examine, at least qualitatively, the variable solvent qualities at which the micelle structures become “frozen in” for different polymer molecular weights. The mean field results for these crew-cut, strongly segregated micelles are consistent with previous mean field calculations, giving α = 0.77 at fixed solvent quality. The Monte Carlo results indicate that nonequilibrium effects result in a weaker power law, as observed experimentally.},

            Polypeptide copolymers can self-assemble into diverse aggregates. The morphology and structure of aggregates can be varied by changing molecular architectures, self-assembling conditions, and introducing secondary components such as polymers and nanoparticles. Polypeptide self-assemblies have gained significant attention because of their potential applications as delivery vehicles for therapeutic payloads and as additives in the biomimetic mineralization of inorganics. This review article provides an overview of recent advances in nanostructures and bioapplications related to polypeptide self-assemblies. We highlight recent contributions to developing strategies for the construction of polypeptide assemblies with increasing complexity and novel functionality that are suitable for bioapplications. The relationship between the structure and properties of the polypeptide aggregates is emphasized. Finally, we briefly outline our perspectives and discuss the challenges in the field.},

The theoretical contributions to this effort are largely attributed to mean-field calculations on a standard Gaussian model. Here, we review this present understanding of block copolymer phase behaviour, the model and its underlying assumptions, the mean-field approximation and its limitations, and the attempts to incorporate fluctuation corrections. Rather than following the traditional rigorous derivations, we present slightly more intuitive and transparent ones in such a way to stress the close connection between the related calculations.

	abstract = {The study of active matter has revealed novel non-equilibrium collective behaviors, illustrating their potential as a new materials platform. However, most works treat active matter as unregulated systems with uniform microscopic energy input, which we refer to as activity. In contrast, functionality in biological materials results from regulating and controlling activity locally over space and time, as has only recently become experimentally possible for engineered active matter. Designing functionality requires navigation of the high dimensional space of spatio-temporal activity patterns, but brute force approaches are unlikely to be successful without system-specific intuition. Here, we apply reinforcement learning to the task of inducing net transport in a specific direction for a simulated system of Vicsek-like self-propelled disks using a spotlight that increases activity locally. The resulting time-varying patterns of activity learned exploit the distinct physics of the strong and weak coupling regimes. Our work shows how reinforcement learning can reveal physically interpretable protocols for controlling collective behavior in non-equilibrium systems.},

	abstract = {The effect of temperature on different grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) technologies installed in Cyprus was analyzed in this study. Initially, the performance losses due to the temperature effect on the annual energy yield of each technology were investigated using measurements of module temperature and the manufacturer provided maximum power point (MPP) temperature coefficients, γPMPP. The same methodology was also applied using outdoor evaluated γPMPP coefficients for comparison. When using the manufacturer’s temperature coefficient, the results showed that over the evaluation period the highest average thermal losses in annual dc energy yield were 8\% for mono-crystalline silicon (mono-c-Si) and 9\% for multi-crystalline silicon (multi-c-Si) technologies while for thin-film technologies, the average losses were 5\%. Similar losses were found when using the outdoor evaluated temperature coefficients. Additionally, temperature effects on the seasonal performance of the different technologies were evident on the monthly average performance ratio (PR). For the amorphous silicon (a-Si) technologies, a performance increase from spring until early autumn was observed and was attributed to thermal annealing. The effect of thermal annealing on the performance was evident by filtering dc MPP power measurements at high irradiance (greater than 800 W/m2) and restricting the values at geometric air mass (AM) in the range 1 ≤ geometric AM ≤ 1.5. The extracted dc MPP power was corrected for irradiance and temperature at standard test conditions (STC) using the manufacturer provided γPMPP over a period of two years. Subsequently, the effect of thermal annealing was further investigated by extracting dc MPP power measurements at geometric AM in the range 1.4 ≤ geometric AM ≤ 1.6 in order to minimize the spectral influences on the performance of a-Si technologies. An increase in power for all the a-Si technologies was obvious during the warm summer season and was recorded over the period of March until September for both years.},

From this we find a simple near-equilibrium approximation for the free energy in terms of an excess mean time-reversed work, which can be experimentally measured on real systems.

However, the sample complexity of model-free algorithms, particularly when using high-dimensional function approximators, tends to limit their applicability to physical systems. In this paper, we explore algorithms and representations to reduce the sample complexity of deep reinforcement learning for continuous control tasks. We propose two complementary techniques for improving the efficiency of such algorithms. First, we derive a continuous variant of the Q-learning algorithm, which we call normalized advantage functions (NAF), as an alternative to the more commonly used policy gradient and actor-critic methods. NAF representation allows us to apply Q-learning with experience replay to continuous tasks, and substantially improves performance on a set of simulated robotic control tasks. To further improve the efficiency of our approach, we explore the use of learned models for accelerating model-free reinforcement learning. We show that iteratively refitted local linear models are especially effective for this, and demonstrate substantially faster learning on domains where such models are applicable.},

Such a relationship can be formulated into a variational principle, for which we have developed an associated optimization algorithm and have used it to determine optimal forces for targeted self-assembly within nonequilibrium steady-states. We illustrate this perspective on inverse design in a model of colloidal cluster assembly within linear shear flow. We find that colloidal clusters can be assembled with high yield using specific short-range interactions of tunable complexity. Shear decreases the yields of rigid clusters, while small values of shear increase the yields of nonrigid clusters. The enhancement or suppression of the yield due to shear is rationalized with a generalized linear response theory. By studying 21 unique clusters made of six, seven, or eight particles, we uncover basic design principles for targeted assembly out of equilibrium.},

	abstract = {Broad-spectrum antiviral platforms that can decrease or inhibit viral infection would alleviate many threats to global public health. Nonetheless, effective technologies of this kind are still not available. Here, we describe a programmable icosahedral canvas for the self-assembly of icosahedral shells that have viral trapping and antiviral properties. Programmable triangular building blocks constructed from DNA assemble with high yield into various shell objects with user-defined geometries and apertures. We have created shells with molecular masses ranging from 43 to 925 MDa (8 to 180 subunits) and with internal cavity diameters of up to 280 nm. The shell interior can be functionalized with virus-specific moieties in a modular fashion. We demonstrate this virus-trapping concept by engulfing hepatitis B virus core particles and adeno-associated viruses. We demonstrate the inhibition of hepatitis B virus core interactions with surfaces in vitro and the neutralization of infectious adeno-associated viruses exposed to human cells.},

But because assembly is a collective phenomenon involving many weakly interacting subunits and a broad range of timescales, measurements of the assembly pathways have been elusive. We use interferometric scattering microscopy to measure the assembly kinetics of individual MS2 bacteriophage capsids around MS2 RNA. By recording how many coat proteins bind to each of many individual RNA strands, we find that assembly proceeds by nucleation followed by monotonic growth. Our measurements reveal the assembly pathways in quantitative detail and also show their failure modes. We use these results to critically examine models of the assembly process.},

However, colloidal assembly is generally initiated via irreversible step-changes and proceeds along unspecified, non-equilibrium kinetic pathways with little opportunity to manipulate defects or reconfigure microstructures. Here, a conceptually new approach that enables the use of feedback control to quantitatively and reversibly guide the dynamic evolution of colloid ensembles between disordered fluid and crystalline configurations is demonstrated. The key to this approach is the use of free energy landscape models to inform feedback control laws that close the loop between real-time sensing (via order parameters) and actuation (via tunable electrical potentials). This approach, which demonstrates controlled assembly to create ordered materials and perform active reconfiguration, is based on chemical physics that suggest it can be generalized to other microscopic processes.},

The state of the system is based on an order parameter representing the overall system configuration, as it transitions from a fluid to a crystalline state. The MDP-based optimal control policy is computed for both the finite- and infinite-horizon cases, with design goals based on maximizing crystallinity.

However, there is no obvious approach to control the assembly of perfectly ordered global free energy minimum structures; near-equilibrium assembly is impractically slow, and faster out-of-equilibrium processes generally terminate in defective states. Here, we demonstrate the rapid and robust assembly of perfect crystals by navigating kinetic bottlenecks using closed-loop control of electric field mediated crystallization of colloidal particles. An optimal policy is computed with dynamic programming using a reaction coordinate based dynamic model. By tracking real-time stochastic particle configurations and adjusting applied fields via feedback, the evolution of unassembled particles is guided through polycrystalline states into single domain crystals. This approach to controlling the assembly of a target structure is based on general principles that make it applicable to a broad range of processes from nano- to microscales (where tuning a global thermodynamic variable yields temporal control over thermal sampling of different states via their relative free energies).},

Recently, several methods have emerged across disciplines that draw upon optimization and simulation to create computer programs that tailor material responses to specified behaviors. However, so far the methods developed either involve black-box techniques, in which the optimizer operates without explicit knowledge of the material’s configuration space, or require carefully tuned algorithms with applicability limited to a narrow subclass of materials. Here we introduce a formalism that can generate optimizers automatically by extending statistical mechanics into the realm of design. The strength of this approach lies in its capability to transform statistical models that describe materials into optimizers to tailor them. By comparing against standard black-box optimization methods, we demonstrate how optimizers generated by this formalism can be faster and more effective, while remaining straightforward to implement. The scope of our approach includes possibilities for solving a variety of complex optimization and design problems concerning materials both in and out of equilibrium.},

The method exploits knowledge of a system’s governing equations to identify a coordinate transformation in which the system dynamics have quadratic structure. This transformation is called a lifting map because it often adds auxiliary variables to the system state. The lifting map is applied to data obtained by evaluating a model for the original nonlinear system. This lifted data is projected onto its leading principal components, and low-dimensional linear and quadratic matrix operators are fit to the lifted reduced data using a least-squares operator inference procedure. Analysis of our method shows that the Lift \& Learn models are able to capture the system physics in the lifted coordinates at least as accurately as traditional intrusive model reduction approaches. This preservation of system physics makes the Lift \& Learn models robust to changes in inputs. Numerical experiments on the FitzHugh–Nagumo neuron activation model and the compressible Euler equations demonstrate the generalizability of our model.},

Equally important is the inverse problem of designing emergent kinetics, but this has received considerably less attention. Using recent advances in automatic differentiation, we show how kinetic pathways can be precisely designed by directly differentiating through statistical physics models, namely free energy calculations and molecular dynamics simulations. We consider two systems that are crucial to our understanding of structural self-assembly: bulk crystallization and small nanoclusters. In each case, we are able to assemble precise dynamical features. Using gradient information, we manipulate interactions among constituent particles to tune the rate at which these systems yield specific structures of interest. Moreover, we use this approach to learn nontrivial features about the high-dimensional design space, allowing us to accurately predict when multiple kinetic features can be simultaneously and independently controlled. These results provide a concrete and generalizable foundation for studying nonstructural self-assembly, including kinetic properties as well as other complex emergent properties, in a vast array of systems.},

Machine Learning techniques based on autoregressive neural networks have been recently shown to provide good approximations of probability distributions of interest in physics. In this work, we propose a systematic way to remove the intrinsic bias associated with these variational approximations, combining it with Markov-chain Monte Carlo in an automatic scheme to efficiently generate cluster updates, which is particularly useful for models for which no efficient cluster update scheme is known. Our approach is based on symmetry-enforced cluster updates building on the neural-network representation of conditional probabilities. We demonstrate that such finite-cluster updates are crucial to circumvent ergodicity problems associated with global neural updates. We test our method for first- and second-order phase transitions in classical spin systems, proving in particular its viability for critical systems, or in the presence of metastable states.},

	abstract = {While the interplay between liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) and glass formation in biological systems is highly relevant for their structure formation and thus function, the exact underlying mechanisms are not well known. The kinetic arrest originates from the slowdown at the molecular level, but how this propagates to the dynamics of microscopic phase domains is not clear. Since with diffusion, viscoelasticity, and hydrodynamics, distinctly different mechanisms are at play, the dynamics needs to be monitored on the relevant time and length scales and compared to theories of phase separation. Using x-ray photon correlation spectroscopy, we determine the LLPS dynamics of a model protein solution upon low temperature quenches and find distinctly different dynamical regimes. We observe that the early stage LLPS is driven by the curvature of the free energy and speeds up upon increasing quench depth. In contrast, the late stage dynamics slows down with increasing quench depth, fingerprinting a nearby glass transition. The dynamics observed shows a ballistic type of motion, implying that viscoelasticity plays an important role during LLPS. We explore possible explanations based on the Cahn-Hilliard theory with nontrivial mobility parameters and find that these can only partially explain our findings.},

	abstract = {{\textless}h3{\textgreater}BACKGROUND{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}Living cells contain distinct subcompartments to facilitate spatiotemporal regulation of biological reactions. In addition to canonical membrane-bound organelles such as secretory vesicles and endoplasmic reticulum, there are many organelles that do not have an enclosing membrane yet remain coherent structures that can compartmentalize and concentrate specific sets of molecules. Examples include assemblies in the nucleus such as the nucleolus, Cajal bodies, and nuclear speckles and also cytoplasmic structures such as stress granules, P-bodies, and germ granules. These structures play diverse roles in various biological processes and are also increasingly implicated in protein aggregation diseases.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}ADVANCES{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}A number of studies have shown that membrane-less assemblies exhibit remarkable liquid-like features. As with conventional liquids, they typically adopt round morphologies and coalesce into a single droplet upon contact with one another and also wet intracellular surfaces such as the nuclear envelope. Moreover, component molecules exhibit dynamic exchange with the surrounding nucleoplasm and cytoplasm. These findings together suggest that these structures represent liquid-phase condensates, which form via a biologically regulated (liquid-liquid) phase separation process. Liquid phase condensation increasingly appears to be a fundamental mechanism for organizing intracellular space. Consistent with this concept, several membrane-less organelles have been shown to exhibit a concentration threshold for assembly, a hallmark of phase separation. At the molecular level, weak, transient interactions between molecules with multivalent domains or intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs) are a driving force for phase separation. In cells, condensation of liquid-phase assemblies can be regulated by active processes, including transcription and various posttranslational modifications. The simplest physical picture of a homogeneous liquid phase is often not enough to capture the full complexity of intracellular condensates, which frequently exhibit heterogeneous multilayered structures with partially solid-like characters. However, recent studies have shown that multiple distinct liquid phases can coexist and give rise to richly structured droplet architectures determined by the relative liquid surface tensions. Moreover, solid-like phases can emerge from metastable liquid condensates via multiple routes of potentially both kinetic and thermodynamic origins, which has important implications for the role of intracellular liquids in protein aggregation pathologies.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}{\textless}h3{\textgreater}OUTLOOK{\textless}/h3{\textgreater} {\textless}p{\textgreater}The list of intracellular assemblies driven by liquid phase condensation is growing rapidly, but our understanding of their sequence-encoded biological function and dysfunction lags behind. Moreover, unlike equilibrium phases of nonliving matter, living cells are far from equilibrium, with intracellular condensates subject to various posttranslational regulation and other adenosine triphosphate–dependent biological activity. Efforts using in vitro reconstitution, combined with traditional cell biology approaches and quantitative biophysical tools, are required to elucidate how such nonequilibrium features of living cells control intracellular phase behavior. The functional consequences of forming liquid condensates are likely multifaceted and may include facilitated reaction, sequestration of specific factors, and organization of associated intracellular structures. Liquid phase condensation is particularly interesting in the nucleus, given the growing interest in the impact of nuclear phase behavior on the flow of genetic information; nuclear condensates range from micrometer-sized bodies such as the nucleolus to submicrometer structures such as transcriptional assemblies, all of which directly interact with and regulate the genome. Deepening our understanding of these intracellular states of matter not only will shed light on the basic biology of cellular organization but also may enable therapeutic intervention in protein aggregation disease by targeting intracellular phase behavior.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

Yet, disentangling precisely how dissipation changes collective effects remains challenging in many-body systems due to the complex interplay between driving and particle interactions. First, we combine explicit coarse-graining and stochastic calculus to obtain simple relations between diffusion, density correlations, and dissipation in nonequilibrium liquids. Based on these results, we consider large-deviation biased ensembles where trajectories mimic the effect of an external drive. The choice of the biasing function is informed by the connection between dissipation and structure derived in the first part. Using analytical and computational techniques, we show that biasing trajectories effectively renormalizes interactions in a controlled manner, thus providing intuition on how driving forces can lead to spatial organization and collective dynamics. Altogether, our results show how tuning dissipation provides a route to alter the structure and dynamics of liquids and soft materials.},

We show that the number of distinct condensates that can be reliably assembled grows superlinearly with the number of species in the mixture when the condensates are allowed to share components. Furthermore, we show that we can predict the maximum number of distinct condensates in a mixture without knowing the details of the pairwise interactions. Simulations of condensate growth confirm these predictions and suggest that the physical rules governing the achievable complexity of condensate-mediated spatial organization are broadly applicable to biomolecular mixtures.},

No explicit assumptions about small parameters or scale separation have to be made. We illustrate the approach with simple, but paradigmatic numerical examples.},

result for equilibrium systems, where we consider Langevin dynamics

to calculate the second order correction to the linear response formula

how the novel nonequilibirum linear response formula can be used to
compute optimal controls of molecular systems for cases in which one

These two extensions work in cooperation to deal with the intolerable computational cost of BP caused by the huge number of existing labels. Moreover, both extensions are generic and can therefore be applied to any MRF energy function as well.

We recover with this framework known results about the asymptotic efficiency of the exponential tilting and obtain new necessary and sufficient conditions for a general change of process to be asymptotically efficient. This allows us to construct new examples of efficient estimators for sample means of random variables that do not have the exponential tilting form.

These laws enforce the Boltzmann distribution in thermal equilibrium: The steady state is then independent of kinetic parameters. In contrast, self-propelled particles tend to accumulate where they move more slowly. They may also slow down at high density for either biochemical or steric reasons. This creates positive feedback, which can lead to motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) between dense and dilute fluid phases. At leading order in gradients, a mapping relates variable-speed, self-propelled particles to passive particles with attractions. This deep link to equilibrium phase separation is confirmed by simulations but generally breaks down at higher order in gradients: New effects, with no equilibrium counterpart, then emerge. We give a selective overview of the fast-developing field of MIPS, focusing on theory and simulation but including a brief speculative survey of its experimental implications.},

The presence of kinetic bottlenecks in such surfaces often renders a direct approach useless. A popular strategy is to identify a small number of key collective variables and to introduce a bias potential that is able to favor their fluctuations in order to accelerate sampling. Here, we propose to use machine-learning techniques in conjunction with the recent variationally enhanced sampling method [O. Valsson, M. Parrinello, Phys. Rev. Lett. 113, 090601 (2014)] in order to determine such potential. This is achieved by expressing the bias as a neural network. The parameters are determined in a variational learning scheme aimed at minimizing an appropriate functional. This required the development of a more efficient minimization technique. The expressivity of neural networks allows representing rapidly varying free-energy surfaces, removes boundary effects artifacts, and allows several collective variables to be handled.},

In this work, we give an informationtheoretic analysis on the generalization error and the excess risk of transfer learning algorithms, following a line of work initiated by Russo and Zhou. Our results suggest, perhaps as expected, that the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence D(μ{\textbar}{\textbar}μ') plays an important role in characterizing the generalization error in the settings of domain adaptation. Specifically, we provide generalization error upper bounds for general transfer learning algorithms, and extend the results to a specific empirical risk minimization (ERM) algorithm where data from both distributions are available in the training phase. We further apply the method to iterative, noisy gradient descent algorithms, and obtain upper bounds which can be easily calculated, only using parameters from the learning algorithms. A few illustrative examples are provided to demonstrate the usefulness of the results. In particular, our bound is tighter in specific classification problems than the bound derived using Rademacher complexity.},

In this paper, we consider transfer learning via dimensionality reduction. To solve this problem, we learn a low-dimensional latent feature space where the distributions between the source domain data and the target domain data are the same or close to each other. Onto this latent feature space, we project the data in related domains where we can apply standard learning algorithms to train classiﬁcation or regression models. Thus, the latent feature space can be treated as a bridge of transferring knowledge from the source domain to the target domain. The main contribution of our work is that we propose a new dimensionality reduction method to ﬁnd a latent space, which minimizes the distance between distributions of the data in different domains in a latent space. The effectiveness of our approach to transfer learning is veriﬁed by experiments in two real world applications: indoor WiFi localization and binary text classiﬁcation.},

Although there are already some valuable and impressive surveys on transfer learning, these surveys introduce approaches in a relatively isolated way and lack the recent advances in transfer learning. Due to the rapid expansion of the transfer learning area, it is both necessary and challenging to comprehensively review the relevant studies. This survey attempts to connect and systematize the existing transfer learning research studies, as well as to summarize and interpret the mechanisms and the strategies of transfer learning in a comprehensive way, which may help readers have a better understanding of the current research status and ideas. Unlike previous surveys, this survey article reviews more than 40 representative transfer learning approaches, especially homogeneous transfer learning approaches, from the perspectives of data and model. The applications of transfer learning are also briefly introduced. In order to show the performance of different transfer learning models, over 20 representative transfer learning models are used for experiments. The models are performed on three different data sets, that is, Amazon Reviews, Reuters-21578, and Office-31, and the experimental results demonstrate the importance of selecting appropriate transfer learning models for different applications in practice.},

Once implemented, these techniques have the potential to reduce costs and save precious materials. Here, we provide a comprehensive overview of the various computational active-learning approaches and outline their potential for drug discovery.},

	abstract = {The aim of computational molecular design is the identification of promising hypothetical molecules with a predefined set of desired properties. We address the issue of accelerating the material discovery with state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. The method involves two different types of prediction; the forward and backward predictions. The objective of the forward prediction is to create a set of machine learning models on various properties of a given molecule. Inverting the trained forward models through Bayes’ law, we derive a posterior distribution for the backward prediction, which is conditioned by a desired property requirement. Exploring high-probability regions of the posterior with a sequential Monte Carlo technique, molecules that exhibit the desired properties can computationally be created. One major difficulty in the computational creation of molecules is the exclusion of the occurrence of chemically unfavorable structures. To circumvent this issue, we derive a chemical language model that acquires commonly occurring patterns of chemical fragments through natural language processing of ASCII strings of existing compounds, which follow the SMILES chemical language notation. In the backward prediction, the trained language model is used to refine chemical strings such that the properties of the resulting structures fall within the desired property region while chemically unfavorable structures are successfully removed. The present method is demonstrated through the design of small organic molecules with the property requirements on HOMO-LUMO gap and internal energy.

While novel approaches to learning node embeddings are highly suitable for node classiﬁcation and link prediction, their application to graph classiﬁcation (predicting a single label for the entire graph) remains mostly rudimentary, typically using a single global pooling step to aggregate node features or a hand-designed, ﬁxed heuristic for hierarchical coarsening of the graph structure. An important step towards ameliorating this is differentiable graph coarsening—the ability to reduce the size of the graph in an adaptive, datadependent manner within a graph neural network pipeline, analogous to image downsampling within CNNs. However, the previous prominent approach to pooling has quadratic memory requirements during training and is therefore not scalable to large graphs. Here we combine several recent advances in graph neural network design to demonstrate that competitive hierarchical graph classiﬁcation results are possible without sacriﬁcing sparsity. Our results are veriﬁed on several established graph classiﬁcation benchmarks, and highlight an important direction for future research in graph-based neural networks.},

	doi = {10.1109/ICDM.2019.00203},
	abstract = {Heterogeneous graphs with different types of nodes and edges are ubiquitous and have immense value in many applications. Existing works on modeling heterogeneous graphs usually follow the idea of splitting a heterogeneous graph into multiple homogeneous subgraphs. This is ineffective in exploiting hidden rich semantic associations between different types of edges for large-scale multi-relational graphs. In this paper, we propose Relation Structure-Aware Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (RSHN), a unified model that integrates graph and its coarsened line graph to embed both nodes and edges in heterogeneous graphs without requiring any prior knowledge such as metapath. To tackle the heterogeneity of edge connections, RSHN first creates a Coarsened Line Graph Neural Network (CL-GNN) to excavate edge-centric relation structural features that respect the latent associations of different types of edges based on coarsened line graph. After that, a Heterogeneous Graph Neural Network (H-GNN) is used to leverage implicit messages from neighbor nodes and edges propagating among nodes in heterogeneous graphs. As a result, different types of nodes and edges can enhance their embedding through mutual integration and promotion. Experiments and comparisons, based on semi-supervised classification tasks on large scale heterogeneous networks with over a hundred types of edges, show that RSHN significantly outperforms state-of-the-arts.},

The limiting latent object is an Itô diﬀusion process that solves a stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE) whose drift and diﬀusion coeﬃcient are implemented by neural nets. We develop a variational inference framework for these neural SDEs via stochastic automatic diﬀerentiation in Wiener space, where the variational approximations to the posterior are obtained by Girsanov (mean-shift) transformation of the standard Wiener process and the computation of gradients is based on the theory of stochastic ﬂows. This permits the use of black-box SDE solvers and automatic diﬀerentiation for end-to-end inference. Experimental results with synthetic data are provided.},

	abstract = {Chemically defined vectors such as cationic polymers are versatile alternatives to engineered viruses for the delivery of genome-editing payloads. However, their clinical translation hinges on rapidly exploring vast chemical design spaces and deriving structure–function relationships governing delivery performance. Here, we discovered a polymer for efficient intracellular ribonucleoprotein (RNP) delivery through combinatorial polymer design and parallelized experimental workflows. A chemically diverse library of 43 statistical copolymers was synthesized via combinatorial RAFT polymerization, realizing systematic variations in physicochemical properties. We selected cationic monomers that varied in their pKa values (8.1–9.2), steric bulk, and lipophilicity of their alkyl substituents. Co-monomers of varying hydrophilicity were also incorporated, enabling elucidation of the roles of protonation equilibria and hydrophobic–hydrophilic balance in vehicular properties and performance. We screened our multiparametric vector library through image cytometry and rapidly uncovered a hit polymer (P38), which outperforms state-of-the-art commercial transfection reagents, achieving nearly 60\% editing efficiency via nonhomologous end-joining. Structure–function correlations underlying editing efficiency, cellular toxicity, and RNP uptake were probed through machine learning approaches to uncover the physicochemical basis of P38’s performance. Although cellular toxicity and RNP uptake were solely determined by polyplex size distribution and protonation degree, respectively, these two polyplex design parameters were found to be inconsequential for enhancing editing efficiency. Instead, polymer hydrophobicity and the Hill coefficient, a parameter describing cooperativity-enhanced polymer deprotonation, were identified as the critical determinants of editing efficiency. Combinatorial synthesis and high-throughput characterization methodologies coupled with data science approaches enabled the rapid discovery of a polymeric vehicle that would have otherwise remained inaccessible to chemical intuition. The statistically derived design rules elucidated herein will guide the synthesis and optimization of future polymer libraries tailored for therapeutic applications of RNP-based genome editing.},

	abstract = {Graph clustering aims to discovercommunity structures in networks, the task being fundamentally challenging mainly because the topology structure and the content of the graphs are difficult to represent for clustering analysis. Recently, graph clustering has moved from traditional shallow methods to deep learning approaches, thanks to the unique feature representation learning capability of deep learning. However, existing deep approaches for graph clustering can only exploit the structure information, while ignoring the content information associated with the nodes in a graph. In this paper, we propose a novel marginalized graph autoencoder (MGAE) algorithm for graph clustering. The key innovation of MGAE is that it advances the autoencoder to the graph domain, so graph representation learning can be carried out not only in a purely unsupervised setting by leveraging structure and content information, it can also be stacked in a deep fashion to learn effective representation. From a technical viewpoint, we propose a marginalized graph convolutional network to corrupt network node content, allowing node content to interact with network features, and marginalizes the corrupted features in a graph autoencoder context to learn graph feature representations. The learned features are fed into the spectral clustering algorithm for graph clustering. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate the superior performance of MGAE, compared to numerous baselines.},

SML is used to unravel the hidden relationship between the XANES features and catalyst geometry. To train our SML method, we rely on ab initio XANES simulations. Our approach allows one to solve the structure of a metal catalyst from its experimental XANES, as demonstrated here by reconstructing the average size, shape, and morphology of well-defined platinum nanoparticles. This method is applicable to the determination of the nanoparticle structure in operando studies and can be generalized to other nanoscale systems.

For transition metal chemistry where accurate calculations are computationally costly and available training data sets are small, the molecular representation becomes a critical ingredient in ML model predictive accuracy. We introduce a series of revised autocorrelation functions (RACs) that encode relationships of the heuristic atomic properties (e.g., size, connectivity, and electronegativity) on a molecular graph. We alter the starting point, scope, and nature of the quantities evaluated in standard ACs to make these RACs amenable to inorganic chemistry. On an organic molecule set, we first demonstrate superior standard AC performance to other presently available topological descriptors for ML model training, with mean unsigned errors (MUEs) for atomization energies on set-aside test molecules as low as 6 kcal/mol. For inorganic chemistry, our RACs yield 1 kcal/mol ML MUEs on set-aside test molecules in spin-state splitting in comparison to 15–20× higher errors for feature sets that encode whole-molecule structural information. Systematic feature selection methods including univariate filtering, recursive feature elimination, and direct optimization (e.g., random forest and LASSO) are compared. Random-forest- or LASSO-selected subsets 4–5× smaller than the full RAC set produce sub- to 1 kcal/mol spin-splitting MUEs, with good transferability to metal–ligand bond length prediction (0.004–5 Å MUE) and redox potential on a smaller data set (0.2–0.3 eV MUE). Evaluation of feature selection results across property sets reveals the relative importance of local, electronic descriptors (e.g., electronegativity, atomic number) in spin-splitting and distal, steric effects in redox potential and bond lengths.},

Additionally, we provide expressions to exactly correct the variational estimate that can be evaluated directly. We benchmark this algorithm against the numerically exact solution of a model of a driven particle in a periodic potential, where the control force can be represented with a complete basis. We then demonstrate the utility of the algorithm in a model of repulsive particles on a line, which undergo a dynamical phase transition, resulting in singular changes to the form of the optimal control force. In both systems, we find fast convergence and are able to evaluate large deviation functions with significant increases in statistical efficiency over alternative Monte Carlo approaches.},

	abstract = {Very often when studying non-equilibrium systems one is interested in analysing dynamical behaviour that occurs with very low probability, so called rare events. In practice, since rare events are by deﬁnition atypical, they are often difﬁcult to access in a statistically signiﬁcant way. What are required are strategies to ‘make rare events typical’ so that they can be generated on demand. Here we present such a general approach to adaptively construct a dynamics that efﬁciently samples atypical events. We do so by exploiting the methods of reinforcement learning (RL), which refers to the set of machine learning techniques aimed at ﬁnding the optimal behaviour to maximise a reward associated with the dynamics. We consider the general perspective of dynamical trajectory ensembles, whereby rare events are described in terms of ensemble reweighting. By minimising the distance between a reweighted ensemble and that of a suitably parametrised controlled dynamics we arrive at a set of methods similar to those of RL to numerically approximate the optimal dynamics that realises the rare behaviour of interest. As simple illustrations we consider in detail the problem of excursions of a random walker, for the case of rare events with a ﬁnite time horizon; and the problem of a studying current statistics of a particle hopping in a ring geometry, for the case of an inﬁnite time horizon. We discuss natural extensions of the ideas presented here, including to continuous-time Markov systems, ﬁrst passage time problems and non-Markovian dynamics.},

	abstract = {The response of a system to an external disturbance can always be expressed in terms of time dependent correlation functions of the undisturbed system. More particularly the linear response of a system disturbed slightly from equilibrium is characterized by the expectation value in the equilibrium ensemble, of a product of two space- and time-dependent operators. When a disturbance leads to a very slow variation in space and time of all physical quantities, the response may alternatively be described by the linearized hydrodynamic equations. The purpose of this paper is to exhibit the complicated structure the correlation functions must have in order that these descriptions coincide. From the hydrodynamic equations the slowly varying part of the expectation values of correlations of densities of conserved quantities is inferred. Two illustrative examples are considered: spin diffusion and transport in an ordinary one-component fluid. Since the descriptions are equivalent, all transport processes which occur in the nonequilibrium system must be exhibited in the equilibrium correlation functions. Thus, when the hydrodynamic equations predict the existence of a diffusion process, the correlation functions will include a part which satisfies a diffusion equation. Similarly when sound waves occur in the nonequilibrium system, they will also be contained in the correlation functions. The description in terms of correlation functions leads naturally to expressions for the transport coefficients like those discussed by Kubo. The analysis also leads to a number of sum rules relating the dissipative linear coefficients to thermodynamic derivatives. It elucidates the peculiarly singular limiting behavior these correlations must have.},

The main difficulty of using a neural network for this problem is that a scatterer has a global impact on the scattered wave field, rendering a typical convolutional neural network with local connections inapplicable. While it is possible to deal with such a problem using a fully connected network, the number of parameters grows quadratically with the size of the input and output data. By leveraging the inherent low-rank structure of the scattering problems and introducing a novel switching layer with sparse connections, the SwitchNet architecture uses far fewer parameters and facilitates the training process.  Numerical experiments show promising accuracy in learning the forward and inverse maps between the scatterers and the scattered wave field.},

This system of FBSDEs can be solved by employing linear regression techniques. The proposed framework relaxes some of the restrictive conditions present in recent sampling based methods within the Linearly Solvable Optimal Control framework, and furthermore addresses problems in which the time horizon is not prespecified. To enhance the efficiency of the proposed scheme when treating more complex nonlinear systems, we then derive an iterative algorithm based on Girsanov’s theorem on the change of measure, which features importance sampling. This scheme is shown to be capable of learning the optimal control without requiring an initial guess.},

For certain linear PDEs it has also been proved mathematically that deep neural networks overcome the curse of dimensionality in the numerical approximation of solutions of such linear PDEs. The key contribution of this article is to rigorously prove this for the first time for a class of nonlinear PDEs. More precisely, we prove in the case of semilinear heat equations with gradient-independent nonlinearities that the numbers of parameters of the employed deep neural networks grow at most polynomially in both the PDE dimension and the reciprocal of the prescribed approximation accuracy. Our proof relies on recently introduced full history recursive multilevel Picard approximations for semilinear PDEs.},

	abstract = {The curse of dimensionality is commonly encountered in numerical partial differential equations (PDE), especially when uncertainties have to be modelled into the equations as random coefficients. However, very often the variability of physical quantities derived from PDE can be captured by a few features on the space of the coefficient fields. Based on such observation, we propose using neural network to parameterise the physical quantity of interest as a function of input coefficients. The representability of such quantity using a neural network can be justified by viewing the neural network as performing time evolution to find the solutions to the PDE. We further demonstrate the simplicity and accuracy of the approach through notable examples of PDEs in engineering and physics.},

	abstract = {Many parameter estimation problems arising in applications can be cast in the framework of Bayesian inversion. This allows not only for an estimate of the parameters, but also for the quantification of uncertainties in the estimates. Often in such problems the parameter-to-data map is very expensive to evaluate, and computing derivatives of the map, or derivative-adjoints, may not be feasible. Additionally, in many applications only noisy evaluations of the map may be available. We propose an approach to Bayesian inversion in such settings that builds on the derivative-free optimization capabilities of ensemble Kalman inversion methods. The overarching approach is to first use ensemble Kalman sampling (EKS) to calibrate the unknown parameters to fit the data; second, to use the output of the EKS to emulate the parameter-to-data map; third, to sample from an approximate Bayesian posterior distribution in which the parameter-to-data map is replaced by its emulator. This results in a principled approach to approximate Bayesian inference that requires only a small number of evaluations of the (possibly noisy approximation of the) parameter-to-data map. It does not require derivatives of this map, but instead leverages the documented power of ensemble Kalman methods. Furthermore, the EKS has the desirable property that it evolves the parameter ensemble towards the regions in which the bulk of the parameter posterior mass is located, thereby locating them well for the emulation phase of the methodology. In essence, the EKS methodology provides a cheap solution to the design problem of where to place points in parameter space to efficiently train an emulator of the parameter-to-data map for the purposes of Bayesian inversion.},

	abstract = {Surrogate modeling and uncertainty quantification tasks for PDE systems are most often considered as supervised learning problems where input and output data pairs are used for training. The construction of such emulators is by definition a small data problem which poses challenges to deep learning approaches that have been developed to operate in the big data regime. Even in cases where such models have been shown to have good predictive capability in high dimensions, they fail to address constraints in the data implied by the PDE model. This paper provides a methodology that incorporates the governing equations of the physical model in the loss/likelihood functions. The resulting physics-constrained, deep learning models are trained without any labeled data (e.g. employing only input data) and provide comparable predictive responses with data-driven models while obeying the constraints of the problem at hand. This work employs a convolutional encoder-decoder neural network approach as well as a conditional flow-based generative model for the solution of PDEs, surrogate model construction, and uncertainty quantification tasks. The methodology is posed as a minimization problem of the reverse Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between the model predictive density and the reference conditional density, where the later is defined as the Boltzmann-Gibbs distribution at a given inverse temperature with the underlying potential relating to the PDE system of interest. The generalization capability of these models to out-of-distribution input is considered. Quantification and interpretation of the predictive uncertainty is provided for a number of problems.},

	abstract = {The remarkable practical success of deep learning has revealed some major surprises from a theoretical perspective. In particular, simple gradient methods easily find near-optimal solutions to non-convex optimization problems, and despite giving a near-perfect fit to training data without any explicit effort to control model complexity, these methods exhibit excellent predictive accuracy. We conjecture that specific principles underlie these phenomena: that overparametrization allows gradient methods to find interpolating solutions, that these methods implicitly impose regularization, and that overparametrization leads to benign overfitting. We survey recent theoretical progress that provides examples illustrating these principles in simpler settings. We first review classical uniform convergence results and why they fall short of explaining aspects of the behavior of deep learning methods. We give examples of implicit regularization in simple settings, where gradient methods lead to minimal norm functions that perfectly fit the training data. Then we review prediction methods that exhibit benign overfitting, focusing on regression problems with quadratic loss. For these methods, we can decompose the prediction rule into a simple component that is useful for prediction and a spiky component that is useful for overfitting but, in a favorable setting, does not harm prediction accuracy. We focus specifically on the linear regime for neural networks, where the network can be approximated by a linear model. In this regime, we demonstrate the success of gradient flow, and we consider benign overfitting with two-layer networks, giving an exact asymptotic analysis that precisely demonstrates the impact of overparametrization. We conclude by highlighting the key challenges that arise in extending these insights to realistic deep learning settings.},

	abstract = {Full-waveform inversion (FWI) is an imaging approach for modeling velocity structure by minimizing the misfit between recorded and predicted seismic waveforms. The strong non-linearity of FWI resulting from fitting oscillatory waveforms can trap the optimization in local minima. We propose a neural-network-based full waveform inversion method (NNFWI) that integrates deep neural networks with FWI by representing the velocity model with a generative neural network. Neural networks can naturally introduce spatial correlations as regularization to the generated velocity model, which suppresses noise in the gradients and mitigates local minima. The velocity model generated by neural networks is input to the same partial differential equation (PDE) solvers used in conventional FWI. The gradients of both the neural networks and PDEs are calculated using automatic differentiation, which back-propagates gradients through the acoustic/elastic PDEs and neural network layers to update the weights and biases of the generative neural network. Experiments on 1D velocity models, the Marmousi model, and the 2004 BP model demonstrate that NNFWI can mitigate local minima, especially for imaging high contrast features like salt bodies, and significantly improves the inversion in the presence of noise. Adding dropout layers to the neural network model also allows analyzing the uncertainty of the inversion results through Monte Carlo dropout. NNFWI opens a new pathway to combine deep learning and FWI for exploiting both the characteristics of deep neural networks and the high accuracy of PDE solvers. Because NNFWI does not require extra training data and optimization loops, it provides an attractive and straightforward alternative to conventional FWI.},

Instead of directly predicting the stress of the material, the SPD-NN trains a neural network to predict the Cholesky factor of the tangent stiffness matrix, based on which the stress is calculated in incremental form. As a result of this special structure, SPD-NN weakly imposes convexity on the strain energy function, satisfies the second order work criterion (Hill's criterion) and time consistency for path-dependent materials, and therefore improves numerical stability, especially when the SPD-NN is used in finite element simulations. Depending on the types of available data, we propose two training methods, namely direct training for strain and stress pairs and indirect training for loads and displacement pairs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of SPD-NN on hyperelastic, elasto-plastic, and multiscale fiber-reinforced plate problems from solid mechanics. The generality and robustness of SPD-NN make it a promising tool for a wide range of constitutive modeling applications.},

Over the past several decades, specialized simulation methods have been developed to overcome this problem. We review one recently developed class of such methods, known as forward flux sampling. Forward flux sampling uses a series of interfaces between the initial and final states to calculate rate constants and generate transition paths for rare events in equilibrium or nonequilibrium systems with stochastic dynamics. This review draws together a number of recent advances, summarizes several applications of the method and highlights challenges that remain to be overcome.},

The equation without the forcing term exhibits several equilibrium configurations, two of which are stable. The solution of the complete forced equation is a stochastic process in space and time that has a unique stochastic equilibrium. The authors study this process in the limit of small noise, and obtain lower and upper bounds for the probability of large fluctuations. They then apply these estimates to calculate the transition probability between the stable configurations (tunnelling). This model problem can be interpreted as a rigorous version of some recent attempts to describe Euclidean quantum systems in terms of stochastic equilibrium states of a nonlinear stochastic differential equation in infinite dimensions. However, its significance goes beyond this situation and the authors' methods may be applicable to models in other areas of natural science.},

We have already analyzed some rather crude exponential decays of these deviation probabilities in Section 7.4. Although these estimates were not asymptotic, they were far from being sharp. These exponential decays are sometimes called strong large-deviation estimates by some authors. In this context, a large-deviation analysis will provide sharp and precise estimates.

Loosely speaking, the initial configuration of an N-particle model consists of N independent particles in a “complete chaos.” Then they evolve and interact with one another. The nature of the interactions depends on the McKean interpretation of the limiting process (see Section 2.5.3). For any fixed time horizon n, when the size of the system N, tends to infinity, any finite block of q(≤ N) particles asymptotically behaves as a collection of independent particles. In other words, the law of any q particle paths of length n converges as N → ∞ towards the q tensor product of the n-path McKean measure.},

While such behavior is ubiquitous in natural and synthetic systems, currently there is no general framework to relate the enhancement of a transition rate to the energy dissipated or to bound the enhancement achievable for a given energy expenditure. We employ recent advances in stochastic thermodynamics to build such a framework, which can be used to gain mechanistic insight into transitions far from equilibrium. We show that under general conditions, there is a basic speed limit relating the typical excess heat dissipated throughout a transition and the rate amplification achievable. We illustrate this tradeoff in canonical examples of diffusive barrier crossings in systems driven with autonomous and deterministic external forcing protocols. In both cases, we find that our speed limit tightly constrains the rate enhancement.},

The proposed method was first tested through three simulated examples involving different PSD shapes, widths, and diameter ranges. Then the GRNN was employed to estimate the PSD of two PS samples; a latex standard of narrow PSD and known nominal diameter, and a latex synthesized in our laboratory. Both samples were also characterized through independent techniques (capillary hydrodynamic fractionation, transmission electron microscopy, and disc centrifugation). For comparison, all examples were solved by numerical inversion of MDLS measurements through a Tikhonov regularization technique. The PSDs estimated by the GRNN gave more accurate results than those obtained through other conventional techniques. The proposed method is a simple, effective, and robust tool for characterizing unimodal PSDs.},

A common approach to go beyond the time- and length-scales accessible with such computationally expensive simulations is the definition of coarse-grained molecular models. Existing coarse-graining approaches define an effective interaction potential to match defined properties of high-resolution models or experimental data. In this paper, we reformulate coarse-graining as a supervised machine learning problem. We use statistical learning theory to decompose the coarse-graining error and cross-validation to select and compare the performance of different models. We introduce CGnets, a deep learning approach, that learns coarse-grained free energy functions and can be trained by a force-matching scheme. CGnets maintain all physically relevant invariances and allow one to incorporate prior physics knowledge to avoid sampling of unphysical structures. We show that CGnets can capture all-atom explicit-solvent free energy surfaces with models using only a few coarse-grained beads and no solvent, while classical coarse-graining methods fail to capture crucial features of the free energy surface. Thus, CGnets are able to capture multibody terms that emerge from the dimensionality reduction.},

	abstract = {Coarse graining enables the investigation of molecular dynamics for larger systems and at longer timescales than is possible at an atomic resolution. However, a coarse graining model must be formulated such that the conclusions we draw from it are consistent with the conclusions we would draw from a model at a finer level of detail. It has been proved that a force matching scheme defines a thermodynamically consistent coarse-grained model for an atomistic system in the variational limit. Wang et al. [ACS Cent. Sci. 5, 755 (2019)] demonstrated that the existence of such a variational limit enables the use of a supervised machine learning framework to generate a coarse-grained force field, which can then be used for simulation in the coarse-grained space. Their framework, however, requires the manual input of molecular features to machine learn the force field. In the present contribution, we build upon the advance of Wang et al. and introduce a hybrid architecture for the machine learning of coarse-grained force fields that learn their own features via a subnetwork that leverages continuous filter convolutions on a graph neural network architecture. We demonstrate that this framework succeeds at reproducing the thermodynamics for small biomolecular systems. Since the learned molecular representations are inherently transferable, the architecture presented here sets the stage for the development of machine-learned, coarse-grained force fields that are transferable across molecular systems.},

	abstract = {A method for estimating the particle size distribution (PSD) of dilute latexes from multiangle dynamic light scattering (MDLS) measurements is presented. The estimation procedure includes two main steps: 1) the calculation of the angle-dependent average diameters of the PSD from MDLS measurements, and 2) the estimation of the PSD through an optimization strategy based on a genetic algorithm (GA). First, the capability of the method was tested on the basis of three simulated examples that involved different PSD shapes, widths, and diameter ranges. Then, the method was employed for estimating the PSD of three samples: a polystyrene latex standard of narrow PSD and known nominal diameter; a mixture of two polystyrene standards of narrow PSDs; and an industrial latex of unknown composition. For comparison, all examples were also solved by numerical inversion of the MDLS autocorrelation measurements through a linear constrained Tikhonov regularization technique. The proposed method appears as an effective and robust tool for characterizing unimodal and multimodal PSDs, without requiring any a priori assumption on the mode shapes or on the PSD diameter range.},

There already exist several excellent lecture notes and reviews on the subject, such as (Hairer 2009) on (non-singular) stochastic PDEs, and (Hairer 2015, Chandra and Weber 2017) on singular stochastic PDEs and regularity structures. The present notes have two main specificities. The first one is that they focus on a particular example, the Allen-Cahn equation, which allows to introduce several of the difficulties of the theory in a gradual way, by increasing the space dimension step by step. The hope is that while this limits the generality of the theory presented, this limitation is more that made up by a gain in clarity. The second specific aspect of these notes is that they go beyond existence and uniqueness of solutions, by covering a few recent results on convergence to equilibrium and metastability in these system.},

We then consider conditions under which the discrete approximations to the diffusion converge. We first show that even when the diffusion itself converges, naive discretizations need not do so. We then consider a 'Metropolis-adjusted' version of the algorithm, and find conditions under which this also converges at an exponential rate: perhaps surprisingly, even the Metropolized version need not converge exponentially fast even if the diffusion does. We briefly discuss a truncated form of the algorithm which, in practice, should avoid the difficulties of the other forms.},

	abstract = {The classical development of neural networks has primarily focused on learning mappings between ﬁnite-dimensional Euclidean spaces. Recently, this has been generalized to neural operators that learn mappings between function spaces. For partial differential equations (PDEs), neural operators directly learn the mapping from any functional parametric dependence to the solution. Thus, they learn an entire family of PDEs, in contrast to classical methods which solve one instance of the equation. In this work, we formulate a new neural operator by parameterizing the integral kernel directly in Fourier space, allowing for an expressive and efﬁcient architecture. We perform experiments on Burgers’ equation, Darcy ﬂow, and Navier-Stokes equation. The Fourier neural operator is the ﬁrst ML-based method to successfully model turbulent ﬂows with zero-shot super-resolution. It is up to three orders of magnitude faster compared to traditional PDE solvers. Additionally, it achieves superior accuracy compared to previous learning-based solvers under ﬁxed resolution.},

We show that this behavior is fundamentally altered if the membrane is pinned randomly due to, e.g., proteins that anchor the membrane to the cytoskeleton. Perturbations which locally restrict membrane height fluctuations induce quenched disorder of the random-field type. This rigorously prevents the formation of macroscopic adhesion domains following the Imry-Ma argument [Y. Imry and S. K. Ma, Phys. Rev. Lett. 35, 1399 (1975)]. Our prediction of random-field disorder follows from analytical calculations, and is strikingly confirmed in large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. These simulations are based on an efficient composite Monte Carlo move, whereby membrane height and bond degrees of freedom are updated simultaneously in a single move. The application of this move should prove rewarding for other systems also.},

	abstract = {In this paper a new method to evaluate the free energy of solids is proposed. The method can be regarded as a variant of the method proposed by Frenkel and Ladd [J. Chem. Phys. 81, 3188 (1984)]. The main equations of the method can be derived in a simple way. The method can be easily implemented within a Monte Carlo program. We have applied the method to determine the free energy of hard spheres in the solid phase for several system sizes. The obtained free energies agree within the numerical uncertainty with those obtained by Polson et al. [J. Chem. Phys. 112, 5339 (2000)]. The fluid-solid equilibria has been determined for several system sizes and compared to the values published previously by Wilding and Bruce [Phys. Rev. Lett. 85, 5138 (2000)] using the phase switch methodology. It is shown that both the free energies and the coexistence pressures present a strong size dependence and that the results obtained from free energy calculations agree with those obtained using the phase switch method, which constitutes a cross-check of both methodologies.

Although techniques such as the indirect umbrella sampling (INDUS) method can be used to characterize solvent fluctuations in static observation volumes of various sizes and shapes, characterizing how the solvent mediates inherently dynamic processes, such as self-assembly or conformational change, remains a challenge. In this work, we generalize the INDUS method to facilitate the enhanced sampling of solvent fluctuations in dynamical observation volumes, whose positions and shapes can evolve. We illustrate the usefulness of this generalization by characterizing water density fluctuations in dynamical volumes pertaining to the hydration of flexible solutes, the assembly of small hydrophobes, and conformational transitions in a model peptide.

	abstract = {Computing accurate reaction rates is a central challenge in computational chemistry and biology because of the high cost of free energy estimation with unbiased molecular dynamics. In this work, a data-driven machine learning algorithm is devised to learn collective variables with a multitask neural network, where a common upstream part reduces the high dimensionality of atomic configurations to a low dimensional latent space, and separate downstream parts map the latent space to predictions of basin class labels and potential energies. The resulting latent space is shown to be an effective low-dimensional representation, capturing the reaction progress and guiding effective umbrella sampling to obtain accurate free energy landscapes. This approach is successfully applied to model systems including a 5D M{\textbackslash}"uller Brown model, a 5D three-well model, and alanine dipeptide in vacuum. This approach enables automated dimensionality reduction for energy controlled reactions in complex systems, offers a unified framework that can be trained with limited data, and outperforms single-task learning approaches, including autoencoders.},

	abstract = {Simultaneously sampling from a complex distribution with intractable normalizing constant and approximating expectations under this distribution is a notoriously challenging problem. We introduce a novel scheme, Invertible Flow Non Equilibrium Sampling (InFiNE), which departs from classical Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) and Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) approaches. InFiNE constructs unbiased estimators of expectations and in particular of normalizing constants by combining the orbits of a deterministic transform started from random initializations. When this transform is chosen as an appropriate integrator of a conformal Hamiltonian system, these orbits are optimization paths. InFiNE is also naturally suited to design new MCMC sampling schemes by selecting samples on the optimization paths. Additionally, InFiNE can be used to construct an Evidence Lower Bound (ELBO) leading to a new class of Variational AutoEncoders (VAE).},

	abstract = {One of the most promising applications for quantum computers is the dynamic simulation of quantum materials. Current hardware, however, sets stringent limitations on how long such simulations can run before decoherence begins to corrupt results. The Jarzynski equality, a fluctuation theorem that allows for the computation of equilibrium free energy differences from an ensemble of short, non-equilibrium dynamics simulations, can make use of such short-time simulations on quantum computers. Here, we present a quantum algorithm based on the Jarzynski equality for computing free energies of quantum materials. We demonstrate our algorithm using the transverse field Ising model on both a quantum simulator and real quantum hardware. As the free energy is a central thermodynamic property that allows one to compute virtually any equilibrium property of a physical system, the ability to perform this algorithm for larger quantum systems in the future has implications for a wide range of applications including the construction of phase diagrams, prediction of transport properties and reaction constants, and computer-aided drug design.},

Using equilibrium analysis and autocorrelation analysis of the time traces, the full energetics as well as real-time kinetics of the ultrafast folding of villin headpiece 35 and a stable asparagine 68 alanine/lysine 70 methionine variant can be measured directly. We also performed Brownian dynamics simulations of the response of the bead-DNA system to protein-folding fluctuations. All key features of the force-dependent deflection fluctuations could be reproduced: SD, skewness, and autocorrelation function. Our measurements reveal a difference in folding pathway and cooperativity between wild-type and stable variant of headpiece 35. Autocorrelation force spectroscopy pushes the time resolution of single-molecule force spectroscopy to ∼10 µs thus approaching the timescales accessible for all atom molecular dynamics simulations.},

	abstract = {The ability to compare two degenerate probability distributions, that is two distributions supported on low-dimensional manifolds in much higher-dimensional spaces, is a crucial factor in the estimation of generative mod- els.It is therefore no surprise that optimal transport (OT) metrics and their ability to handle measures with non-overlapping sup- ports have emerged as a promising tool. Yet, training generative machines using OT raises formidable computational and statistical challenges, because of (i) the computational bur- den of evaluating OT losses, (ii) their instability and lack of smoothness, (iii) the difficulty to estimate them, as well as their gradients, in high dimension. This paper presents the first tractable method to train large scale generative models using an OT-based loss called Sinkhorn loss which tackles these three issues by relying on two key ideas: (a) entropic smoothing, which turns the original OT loss into a differentiable and more robust quantity that can be computed using Sinkhorn fixed point iterations; (b) algorithmic (automatic) differentiation of these iterations with seam- less GPU execution. Additionally, Entropic smoothing generates a family of losses interpolating between Wasserstein (OT) and Energy distance/Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) losses, thus allowing to find a sweet spot leveraging the geometry of OT on the one hand, and the favorable high-dimensional sample complexity of MMD, which comes with un- biased gradient estimates. The resulting computational architecture complements nicely standard deep network generative models by a stack of extra layers implementing the loss function.},

PauliNet has a multireference Hartree–Fock solution built in as a baseline, incorporates the physics of valid wavefunctions and is trained using variational quantum Monte Carlo. PauliNet outperforms previous state-of-the-art variational ansatzes for atoms, diatomic molecules and a strongly correlated linear H10, and matches the accuracy of highly specialized quantum chemistry methods on the transition-state energy of cyclobutadiene, while being computationally efficient.},

Exact wave functions of interesting chemical systems are out of reach because they are NP-hard to compute in general, but approximations can be found using polynomially scaling algorithms. The key challenge for many of these algorithms is the choice of wave function approximation, or Ansatz, which must trade off between efficiency and accuracy. Neural networks have shown impressive power as accurate practical function approximators and promise as a compact wave-function Ansatz for spin systems, but problems in electronic structure require wave functions that obey Fermi-Dirac statistics. Here we introduce a novel deep learning architecture, the Fermionic neural network, as a powerful wave-function Ansatz for many-electron systems. The Fermionic neural network is able to achieve accuracy beyond other variational quantum Monte Carlo Ansatz on a variety of atoms and small molecules. Using no data other than atomic positions and charges, we predict the dissociation curves of the nitrogen molecule and hydrogen chain, two challenging strongly correlated systems, to significantly higher accuracy than the coupled cluster method, widely considered the most accurate scalable method for quantum chemistry at equilibrium geometry. This demonstrates that deep neural networks can improve the accuracy of variational quantum Monte Carlo to the point where it outperforms other ab initio quantum chemistry methods, opening the possibility of accurate direct optimization of wave functions for previously intractable many-electron systems.},

Variance reduction techniques can lower the estimation error, sometimes by a large factor, but rarely change the convergence rate of the estimation error. This error usually decreases as the inverse square root of the computational effort, as dictated by the central limit theorem. In theory, there exist simulation estimators with zero variance, i.e., that always provide the exact value. The catch is that these estimators are usually much too difﬁcult (or virtually impossible) to implement. However, there are situations, especially in the context of rare-event simulation, where the zero-variance simulation can be approximated well enough to provide huge efﬁciency gains. Adaptive versions can even yield a faster convergence rate, including exponential convergence in some cases. This paper gives a brief overview of these methods and discuss their practicality.},

The system exhibits a range of interesting dynamical behaviors including a Hopf-bifurcation transition between equilibrium-point trapping and the so-called limit cycle in which the particles are confined to circular orbits.

	abstract = {Although dynamic self-assembly, DySA, is a relatively new area of research, the past decade has brought numerous demonstrations of how various types of components – on scales from (macro)molecular to macroscopic – can be arranged into ordered structures thriving in non-equilibrium, steady states. At the same time, none of these dynamic assemblies has so far proven practically relevant, prompting questions about the field's prospects and ultimate objectives. The main thesis of this Review is that formation of dynamic assemblies cannot be an end in itself – instead, we should think more ambitiously of using such assemblies as control elements (reconfigurable catalysts, nanomachines, etc.) of larger, networked systems directing sequences of chemical reactions or assembly tasks. Such networked systems would be inspired by biology but intended to operate in environments and conditions incompatible with living matter (e.g., in organic solvents, elevated temperatures, etc.). To realize this vision, we need to start considering not only the interactions mediating dynamic self-assembly of individual components, but also how components of different types could coexist and communicate within larger, multicomponent ensembles. Along these lines, the review starts with the discussion of the conceptual foundations of self-assembly in equilibrium and non-equilibrium regimes. It discusses key examples of interactions and phenomena that can provide the basis for various DySA modalities (e.g., those driven by light, magnetic fields, flows, etc.). It then focuses on the recent examples where organization of components in steady states is coupled to other processes taking place in the system (catalysis, formation of dynamic supramolecular materials, control of chirality, etc.). With these examples of functional DySA, we then look forward and consider conditions that must be fulfilled to allow components of multiple types to coexist, function, and communicate with one another within the networked DySA systems of the future. As the closing examples show, such systems are already appearing heralding new opportunities – and, to be sure, new challenges – for DySA research.},

We focus on: (1) attempts to formulate design principles to tailor active particles; (2) attempts to design principles according to which active particles interact under circumstances where particle–particle interactions of traditional colloid science are augmented by a family of nonequilibrium effects discussed here; (3) attempts to design intended patterns of collective behavior and dynamic assembly; (4) speculative links to equilibrium thermodynamics.

Combining deep learning and statistical mechanics, we developed Boltzmann generators, which are shown to generate unbiased one-shot equilibrium samples of representative condensed-matter systems and proteins. Boltzmann generators use neural networks to learn a coordinate transformation of the complex configurational equilibrium distribution to a distribution that can be easily sampled. Accurate computation of free-energy differences and discovery of new configurations are demonstrated, providing a statistical mechanics tool that can avoid rare events during sampling without prior knowledge of reaction coordinates.},

	abstract = {Nanomanipulation of individual RNA molecules, using laser optical tweezers, has made it possible to infer the major features of their energy landscape. Time-dependent mechanical unfolding trajectories, measured at a constant stretching force (fS) of simple RNA structures (hairpins and three-helix junctions) sandwiched between RNA/DNA hybrid handles show that they unfold in a reversible all-or-none manner. To provide a molecular interpretation of the experiments we use a general coarse-grained off-lattice Go -like model, in which each nucleotide is represented using three interaction sites. Using the coarsegrained model we have explored forced-unfolding of RNA hairpin as a function of fS and the loading rate (rf). The simulations and theoretical analysis have been done both with and without the handles that are explicitly modeled by semiﬂexible polymer chains. The mechanisms and timescales for denaturation by temperature jump and mechanical unfolding are vastly different. The directed perturbation of the native state by fS results in a sequential unfolding of the hairpin starting from their ends, whereas thermal denaturation occurs stochastically. From the dependence of the unfolding rates on rf and fS we show that the position of the unfolding transition state is not a constant but moves dramatically as either rf or fS is changed. The transitionstate movements are interpreted by adopting the Hammond postulate for forced-unfolding. Forced-unfolding simulations of RNA, with handles attached to the two ends, show that the value of the unfolding force increases (especially at high pulling speeds) as the length of the handles increases. The pathways for refolding of RNA from stretched initial conformation, upon quenching fS to the quench force fQ, are highly heterogeneous. The refolding times, upon force-quench, are at least an order-ofmagnitude greater than those obtained by temperature-quench. The long fQ-dependent refolding times starting from fully stretched states are analyzed using a model that accounts for the microscopic steps in the rate-limiting step, which involves the trans to gauche transitions of the dihedral angles in the GAAA tetraloop. The simulations with explicit molecular model for the handles show that the dynamics of force-quench refolding is strongly dependent on the interplay of their contour length and persistence length and the RNA persistence length. Using the generality of our results, we also make a number of precise experimentally testable predictions.},

We show that for representative transition metal triatomics (MO2, where M = Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, or Ni) and related diatomics the incorporation of Hartree−Fock (HF) exchange in most cases improves the properties of the Born− Oppenheimer potential energy surface (PES) with respect to accurate experimental or CCSD(T) references. We rationalize this observation by noting reduced delocalization obtained with hybrid functionals (20−40\% HF exchange), as evidenced by reduced hybridization of non-bonding orbitals and increases in metal partial charges. Although we show that the optimal exchange fraction is both property and system speciﬁc, incorporating HF exchange synergistically improves properties of density, structure, and energetics within a single PES characterized by moderately covalent bonding. The same improvement is not observed in the ordering of MO2 spin states, as good agreement of semi-local DFT spin state ordering is worsened by over-stabilization of higher spin states when HF exchange is added. More work is needed to understand minimal functional forms capable of improving multiple properties with respect to semi-local DFT descriptions of transition metal chemistry.},

The kernel ridge regression is used in the construction of the adiabatic PESs. In the nonadiabatic dynamics simulation, we use ML-PESs for most geometries and switch back to the electronic structure calculations for a few geometries either near the S1/S0 conical intersections or in the out-of-confidence regions. The dynamics results based on ML-PESs are consistent with those based on CASSCF PESs.

As a generalization of the popular surface hopping method, SHARC allows simulating the full-dimensional dynamics of molecules including any type of coupling terms beyond nonadiabatic couplings. Examples of these arbitrary couplings include spin–orbit couplings or dipole moment–laser field couplings, such that SHARC can describe ultrafast internal conversion, intersystem crossing, and radiative processes. The key step of the SHARC approach consists of a diagonalization of the Hamiltonian including these couplings, such that the nuclear dynamics is carried out on potential energy surfaces including the effects of the couplings—this is critical in any applications considering, for example, transition metal complexes or strong laser fields. We also give an overview over the new SHARC2.0 dynamics software package, released under the GNU General Public License, which implements the SHARC approach and several analysis tools.

	abstract = {High-throughput computational screening for chemical discovery mandates the automated and unsupervised simulation of thousands of new molecules and materials. In challenging materials spaces, such as open shell transition metal chemistry, characterization requires time-consuming first-principles simulation that often necessitates human intervention. These calculations can frequently lead to a null result, e.g., the calculation does not converge or the molecule does not stay intact during a geometry optimization. To overcome this challenge toward realizing fully automated chemical discovery in transition metal chemistry, we have developed the first machine learning models that predict the likelihood of successful simulation outcomes. We train support vector machine and artificial neural network classifiers to predict simulation outcomes (i.e., geometry optimization result and degree of {\textless}S2{\textgreater} deviation) for a chosen electronic structure method based on chemical composition. For these static models, we achieve an area under the curve of at least 0.95, minimizing computational time spent on nonproductive simulations and therefore enabling efficient chemical space exploration. We introduce a metric of model uncertainty based on the distribution of points in the latent space to systematically improve model prediction confidence. In a complementary approach, we train a convolutional neural network classification model on simulation output electronic and geometric structure time series data. This dynamic model generalizes more readily than the static classifier by becoming more predictive as input simulation length increases. Finally, we describe approaches for using these models to enable autonomous job control in transition metal complex discovery.},

	abstract = {As machine learning (ML) has matured, it has opened a new frontier in theoretical and computational chemistry by offering the promise of simultaneous paradigm shifts in accuracy and efficiency. Nowhere is this advance more needed, but also more challenging to achieve, than in the discovery of open-shell transition metal complexes. Here, localized d or f electrons exhibit variable bonding that is challenging to capture even with the most computationally demanding methods. Thus, despite great promise, clear obstacles remain in constructing ML models that can supplement or even replace explicit electronic structure calculations. In this article, I outline the recent advances in building ML models in transition metal chemistry, including the ability to approach sub-kcal/mol accuracy on a range of properties with tailored representations, to discover and enumerate complexes in large chemical spaces, and to reveal opportunities for design through analysis of feature importance. I discuss unique considerations that have been essential to enabling ML in open-shell transition metal chemistry, including (a) the relationship of data set size/diversity, model complexity, and representation choice, (b) the importance of quantitative assessments of both theory and model domain of applicability, and (c) the need to enable autonomous generation of reliable, large data sets both for ML model training and in active learning or discovery contexts. Finally, I summarize the next steps toward making ML a mainstream tool in the accelerated discovery of transition metal complexes.

	abstract = {We have recently shown how high-accuracy wave function grid-based propagation schemes, such as the multiconﬁguration time-dependent Hartree (MCTDH) method, can be combined with machine-learning (ML) descriptions of PESs to yield an “on-the-ﬂy” direct dynamics scheme which circumvents potential energy surface (PES) preﬁtting. To date, our approach has been demonstrated in the ground-state dynamics and nonadiabatic spinallowed dynamics of several molecular systems. Expanding on this successful previous work, this Article demonstrates how our MLbased quantum dynamics scheme can be adapted to model nonadiabatic dynamics for spin-forbidden processes such as intersystem crossing (ISC), opening up new possibilities for modeling chemical dynamic phenomena driven by spin−orbit coupling. After describing modiﬁcations to diabatization schemes to enable accurate and robust treatment or electronic states of diﬀerent spin-multiplicity, we demonstrate our methodology in applications to modeling ISC in SO2 and thioformaldehyde, benchmarking our results against previous trajectory- and grid-based calculations. As a relatively eﬃcient tool for modeling spin-forbidden nonadiabatic dynamics without demanding any preﬁtting of PESs, our overall strategy is a potentially powerful tool for modeling important photochemical systems, such as photoactivated prodrugs and organometallic catalysts.},

The data efficiency of the sGDML approach implies that atomic forces for these conformations can be computed with high-level wavefunction-based approaches, such as the “gold standard” coupled-cluster theory with single, double and perturbative triple excitations [CCSD(T)]. We demonstrate that the flexible nature of the sGDML model recovers local and non-local electronic interactions (e.g., H-bonding, proton transfer, lone pairs, changes in hybridization states, steric repulsion, and n → π* interactions) without imposing any restriction on the nature of interatomic potentials. The analysis of sGDML molecular dynamics trajectories yields new qualitative insights into dynamics and spectroscopy of small molecules close to spectroscopic accuracy.},

The behavior of molecular systems at the microscale is typically simulated with differential equations parameterized by a Hamiltonian, or energy function. The Hamiltonian describes the state of the system and its interactions with the environment. In order to derive predictive microscopic models, one wishes to infer a molecular Hamiltonian that agrees with observed macroscopic quantities. From the perspective of engineering, one wishes to control the Hamiltonian to achieve desired simulation outcomes and structures, as in self-assembly and optical control, to then realize systems with the desired Hamiltonian in the lab. In both cases, the goal is to modify the Hamiltonian such that emergent properties of the simulated system match a given target. We demonstrate how this can be achieved using differentiable simulations where bulk target observables and simulation outcomes can be analytically differentiated with respect to Hamiltonians, opening up new routes for parameterizing Hamiltonians to infer macroscopic models and develop control protocols.},

	abstract = {Modeling dynamical effects in chemical reactions, such as post-transition state bifurcation, requires ab initio molecular dynamics simulations due to the breakdown of simpler static models like transition state theory. However, these simulations tend to be restricted to lower-accuracy electronic structure methods and scarce sampling because of their high computational cost. Here, we report the use of statistical learning to accelerate reactive molecular dynamics simulations by combining high-throughput ab initio calculations, graph-convolution interatomic potentials and active learning. This pipeline was demonstrated on an ambimodal trispericyclic reaction involving 8,8-dicyanoheptafulvene and 6,6-dimethylfulvene. With a dataset size of approximately31,000 M062X/def2-SVP quantum mechanical calculations, the computational cost of exploring the reactive potential energy surface was reduced by an order of magnitude. Thousands of virtually costless picosecond-long reactive trajectories suggest that post-transition state bifurcation plays a minor role for the reaction in vacuum. Furthermore, a transfer-learning strategy effectively upgraded the potential energy surface to higherlevels of theory ((SMD-)M06-2X/def2-TZVPD in vacuum and three other solvents, as well as the more accurate DLPNO-DSD-PBEP86 D3BJ/def2-TZVPD) using about 10\% additional calculations for each surface. Since the larger basis set and the dynamic correlation capture intramolecular non-covalent interactions more accurately, they uncover longer lifetimes for the charge-separated intermediate on the more accurate potential energy surfaces. The character of the intermediate switches from entropic to thermodynamic upon including implicit solvation effects, with lifetimes increasing with solvent polarity. Analysis of 2,000 reactive trajectories on the chloroform PES shows a qualitative agreement with the experimentally-reported periselectivity for this reaction. This overall approach is broadly applicable and opens a door to the study of dynamical effects in larger, previously-intractable reactive systems.},

	abstract = {Stochastic gradient descent (SGD) is widely believed to perform implicit regularization when used to train deep neural networks, but the precise manner in which this occurs has thus far been elusive. We prove that SGD minimizes an average potential over the posterior distribution of weights along with an entropic regularization term. This potential is however not the original loss function in general. So SGD does perform variational inference, but for a different loss than the one used to compute the gradients. Even more surprisingly, SGD does not even converge in the classical sense: we show that the most likely trajectories of SGD for deep networks do not behave like Brownian motion around critical points. Instead, they resemble closed loops with deterministic components. We prove that such “out-of-equilibrium” behavior is a consequence of highly non-isotropic gradient noise in SGD; the covariance matrix of mini-batch gradients for deep networks has a rank as small as 1\% of its dimension. We provide extensive empirical validation of these claims, proven in the appendix.},

	abstract = {Actinide chemistry is gaining increased focus in modern research, particularly in the fields of energy research and molecular magnetism. However, the structure–function and structure–property relationships of actinides have still not been studied as intensely as those for transition metals. In this work, we report a detailed ab initio study of the spectroscopic, magnetic, and bonding properties of the trivalent actinide free ions and their associated hexachloride complexes in octahedral symmetry. The electronic structures of these systems are examined using complete active-space self-consistent-field calculations followed by second-order N-electron valence perturbation theory, including both scalar relativistic and spin–orbit-coupling effects. The computed energies and wave functions are further analyzed by means of ab initio ligand-field theory (AILFT) and finally chemically interpreted by means of the angular overlap model (AOM). The derived Slater–Condon and spin–orbit parameters have allowed us to systematically rationalize the spectroscopic and magnetic properties of the investigated free ions and complexes along the entire actinide series. Overall, the AILFT- and AOM-derived parameters accurately reproduce the multireference electronic structure calculations. The small observed discrepancies with respect to experimentally derived ligand-field parameters are essentially due to an underestimation of the electronic correlation, which arises from both the constrained size of the active space (restricted to the f orbitals) and the limit of the perturbation approach to account for dynamical correlation. Our analysis also provides insight into the metal–ligand covalency trends along the series. Consistent with natural population analysis, the nephelauxetic (Slater–Condon parameters) and relativistic nephelauxetic (spin–orbit-coupling) reductions determined for these complexes indicate a decrease in the covalency along the series. These trends also hold, to varying extents, for the corresponding tetravalent derivatives, as well as the lanthanide analogues.},

	abstract = {Several recent trends in machine learning theory and practice, from the design of state-of-the-art Gaussian Process to the convergence analysis of deep neural nets (DNNs) under stochastic gradient descent (SGD), have found it fruitful to study wide random neural networks. Central to these approaches are certain scaling limits of such networks. We unify these results by introducing a notion of a straightline tensor program that can express most neural network computations, and we characterize its scaling limit when its tensors are large and randomized. From our framework follows 1. the convergence of random neural networks to Gaussian processes for architectures such as recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks, residual networks, attention, and any combination thereof, with or without batch normalization; 2. conditions under which the gradient independence assumption –that weights in backpropagation can be assumed to be independent from weights in the forward pass – leads to correct computation of gradient dynamics, and corrections when it does not; 3. the convergence of the Neural Tangent Kernel, a recently proposed kernel used to predict training dynamics of neural networks under gradient descent, at initialization for all architectures in (1) without batch normalization. Mathematically, our framework is general enough to rederive classical random matrix results such as the semicircle and the Marchenko-Pastur laws, as well as recent results in neural network Jacobian singular values. We hope our work opens a way toward design of even stronger Gaussian Processes, initialization schemes to avoid gradient explosion/vanishing, and deeper understanding of SGD dynamics in modern architectures.},

	abstract = {While graph kernels (GKs) are easy to train and enjoy provable theoretical guarantees, their practical performances are limited by their expressive power, as the kernel function often depends on hand-crafted combinatorial features of graphs. Compared to graph kernels, graph neural networks (GNNs) usually achieve better practical performance, as GNNs use multi-layer architectures and non-linear activation functions to extract high-order information of graphs as features. However, due to the large number of hyper-parameters and the non-convex nature of the training procedure, GNNs are harder to train. Theoretical guarantees of GNNs are also not well-understood. Furthermore, the expressive power of GNNs scales with the number of parameters, and thus it is hard to exploit the full power of GNNs when computing resources are limited. The current paper presents a new class of graph kernels, Graph Neural Tangent Kernels (GNTKs), which correspond to inﬁnitely wide multi-layer GNNs trained by gradient descent. GNTKs enjoy the full expressive power of GNNs and inherit advantages of GKs. Theoretically, we show GNTKs provably learn a class of smooth functions on graphs. Empirically, we test GNTKs on graph classiﬁcation datasets and show they achieve strong performance.},

Moreover, residual networks seem to enable very deep networks by leveraging only the short paths during training. To support this observation, we rewrite residual networks as an explicit collection of paths. Unlike traditional models, paths through residual networks vary in length. Further, a lesion study reveals that these paths show ensemble-like behavior in the sense that they do not strongly depend on each other. Finally, and most surprising, most paths are shorter than one might expect, and only the short paths are needed during training, as longer paths do not contribute any gradient. For example, most of the gradient in a residual network with 110 layers comes from paths that are only 10-34 layers deep. Our results reveal one of the key characteristics that seem to enable the training of very deep networks: Residual networks avoid the vanishing gradient problem by introducing short paths which can carry gradient throughout the extent of very deep networks.},

	abstract = {Training deep neural networks with stochastic gradient descent (SGD) can often achieve zero training loss on real-world tasks although the optimization landscape is known to be highly non-convex. To understand the success of SGD for training deep neural networks, this work presents a mean-ﬁeld analysis of deep residual networks, based on a line of works that interpret the continuum limit of the deep residual network as an ordinary diﬀerential equation when the network capacity tends to inﬁnity. Speciﬁcally, we propose a new continuum limit of deep residual networks, which enjoys a good landscape in the sense that every local minimizer is global. This characterization enables us to derive the ﬁrst global convergence result for multilayer neural networks in the mean-ﬁeld regime. Furthermore, without assuming the convexity of the loss landscape, our proof relies on a zero-loss assumption at the global minimizer that can be achieved when the model shares a universal approximation property. Key to our result is the observation that a deep residual network resembles a shallow network ensemble [63], i.e. a two-layer network. We bound the diﬀerence between the shallow network and our ResNet model via the adjoint sensitivity method, which enables us to apply existing mean-ﬁeld analyses of two-layer networks to deep networks. Furthermore, we propose several novel training schemes based on the new continuous model, including one training procedure that switches the order of the residual blocks and results in strong empirical performance on the benchmark datasets.},

	abstract = {We investigate the dynamical and convergent properties of stochastic gradient descent (SGD) applied to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). Characterizing the relation between learning rate, batch size and the properties of the ﬁnal minima, such as width or generalization, remains an open question. In order to tackle this problem we investigate the previously proposed approximation of SGD by a stochastic diﬀerential equation (SDE). We theoretically argue that three factors - learning rate, batch size and gradient covariance - inﬂuence the minima found by SGD. In particular we ﬁnd that the ratio of learning rate to batch size is a key determinant of SGD dynamics and of the width of the ﬁnal minima, and that higher values of the ratio lead to wider minima and often better generalization. We conﬁrm these ﬁndings experimentally. Further, we include experiments which show that learning rate schedules can be replaced with batch size schedules and that the ratio of learning rate to batch size is an important factor inﬂuencing the memorization process.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09375},
	abstract = {While deep learning is successful in a number of applications, it is not yet well understood theoretically. A satisfactory theoretical characterization of deep learning however, is beginning to emerge. It covers the following questions: 1) representation power of deep networks 2) optimization of the empirical risk 3) generalization properties of gradient descent techniques --- why the expected error does not suffer, despite the absence of explicit regularization, when the networks are overparametrized? In this review we discuss recent advances in the three areas. In approximation theory both shallow and deep networks have been shown to approximate any continuous functions on a bounded domain at the expense of an exponential number of parameters (exponential in the dimensionality of the function). However, for a subset of compositional functions, deep networks of the convolutional type can have a linear dependence on dimensionality, unlike shallow networks. In optimization we discuss the loss landscape for the exponential loss function and show that stochastic gradient descent will find with high probability the global minima. To address the question of generalization for classification tasks, we use classical uniform convergence results to justify minimizing a surrogate exponential-type loss function under a unit norm constraint on the weight matrix at each layer -- since the interesting variables for classification are the weight directions rather than the weights. Our approach, which is supported by several independent new results, offers a solution to the puzzle about generalization performance of deep overparametrized ReLU networks, uncovering the origin of the underlying hidden complexity control.},

	abstract = {The key to generalization is controlling the complexity of the network. However, there is no obvious control of complexity – such as an explicit regularization term – in the training of deep networks for classiﬁcation. We will show that a classical form of norm control – but kind of hidden – is present in deep networks trained with gradient descent techniques on exponential-type losses. In particular, gradient descent induces a dynamics of the normalized weights which converge for t → ∞ to an equilibrium which corresponds to a minimum norm (or maximum margin) solution. For suﬃciently large but ﬁnite ρ – and thus ﬁnite t – the dynamics converges to one of several margin maximizers, with the margin monotonically increasing towards a limit stationary point of the ﬂow. In the usual case of stochastic gradient descent, most of the stationary points are likely to be convex minima corresponding to a constrained minimizer – the network with normalized weights– which corresponds to vanishing regularization. The solution has zero generalization gap, for ﬁxed architecture, asymptotically for N → ∞, where N is the number of training examples. Our approach extends some of the original results of Srebro from linear networks to deep networks and provides a new perspective on the implicit bias of gradient descent. We believe that the elusive complexity control we describe is responsible for the puzzling empirical ﬁnding of good predictive performance by deep networks, despite overparameterization.},

Our new framework is derived from the Mori-Zwanzig formalism to obtain an exact evolution of the node infection probabilities, which renders a delay differential equation with memory integral approximated by learnable time convolution operators, resulting in a highly structured and interpretable RNN. Directly using cascade data, our framework can jointly learn the structure of the diffusion network and the evolution of infection probabilities, which are cornerstone to important downstream applications such as inﬂuence maximization. Connections between parameter learning and optimal control are also established. Empirical study shows that our approach is versatile and robust to variations of the underlying diffusion network models, and signiﬁcantly outperforms existing approaches in accuracy and efﬁciency on both synthetic and real-world data.},

Graph convolutions use a simple encoding of the molecular graph—atoms, bonds, distances, etc.—which allows the model to take greater advantage of information in the graph structure.

Here, we show that propagation of membrane tension occurs quickly in cell-attached blebs but is largely suppressed in intact cells. The failure of tension to propagate in cells is explained by a ﬂuid dynamical model that incorporates the ﬂow resistance from cytoskeleton-bound transmembrane proteins. Perturbations to tension propagate diffusively, with a diffusion coefﬁcient Ds \$0.024 mm2/s in HeLa cells. In primary endothelial cells, local increases in membrane tension lead only to local activation of mechanosensitive ion channels and to local vesicle fusion. Thus, membrane tension is not a mediator of long-range intracellular signaling, but local variations in tension mediate distinct processes in sub-cellular domains.},

	abstract = {Graph neural networks (GNNs) are typically applied to static graphs that are assumed to be known upfront. This static input structure is often informed purely by insight of the machine learning practitioner, and might not be optimal for the actual task the GNN is solving. In absence of reliable domain expertise, one might resort to inferring the latent graph structure, which is often difﬁcult due to the vast search space of possible graphs. Here we introduce Pointer Graph Networks (PGNs) which augment sets or graphs with additional inferred edges for improved model generalisation ability. PGNs allow each node to dynamically point to another node, followed by message passing over these pointers. The sparsity of this adaptable graph structure makes learning tractable while still being sufﬁciently expressive to simulate complex algorithms. Critically, the pointing mechanism is directly supervised to model long-term sequences of operations on classical data structures, incorporating useful structural inductive biases from theoretical computer science. Qualitatively, we demonstrate that PGNs can learn parallelisable variants of pointer-based data structures, namely disjoint set unions and link/cut trees. PGNs generalise out-of-distribution to 5× larger test inputs on dynamic graph connectivity tasks, outperforming unrestricted GNNs and Deep Sets.},

Thermomers are based on a sharply thermolabile coiled-coil protein, which we engineered to heterodimerize at a tunable transition temperature within the biocompatible range of 37−42 °C. When fused to other proteins, thermomers can reversibly control their association, as demonstrated via membrane localization in mammalian cells.

By simultaneously measuring the ﬂuorescence of distinct thermochromic dyes attached to the particle surface or dissolved in the surrounding ﬂuid during radio frequency magnetic stimulation, we found no measurable difference between the nanoparticle surface temperature and that of the surrounding ﬂuid for three distinct nanoparticle types. Furthermore, the metalloprotein ferritin produced no temperature increase on the protein surface nor in the surrounding ﬂuid.

	abstract = {Genetically engineered T-cells are being developed to perform a variety of therapeutic functions. However, no robust mechanisms exist to externally control the activity of T-cells at specific locations within the body. Such spatiotemporal control could help mitigate potential off-target toxicity due to incomplete molecular specificity in applications such as T-cell immunotherapy against solid tumors. Temperature is a versatile external control signal that can be delivered to target tissues in vivo using techniques such as focused ultrasound and magnetic hyperthermia. Here, we test the ability of heat shock promoters to mediate thermal actuation of genetic circuits in primary human T-cells in the well-tolerated temperature range of 37–42ºC, and introduce genetic architectures enabling the tuning of the amplitude and duration of thermal activation. We demonstrate the use of these circuits to control the expression of chimeric antigen receptors and cytokines, and the killing of target tumor cells. This technology provides a critical tool to direct the activity of T-cells after they are deployed inside the body.},

To ensure adequate exploration, we introduce an off-policy actor-critic algorithm that learns a deterministic target policy from an exploratory behaviour policy.

The main challenge is to devise representations of atomic systems that are at the same time complete and concise, so as to reduce the number of reference calculations that are needed to predict the properties of different types of materials reliably. This has led to a proliferation of alternative ways to convert an atomic structure into an input for a machine-learning model. We introduce an abstract deﬁnition of chemical environments that is based on a smoothed atomic density, using a bra-ket notation to emphasize basis set independence and to highlight the connections with some popular choices of representations for describing atomic systems. The correlations between the spatial distribution of atoms and their chemical identities are computed as inner products between these feature kets, which can be given an explicit representation in terms of the expansion of the atom density on orthogonal basis functions, that is equivalent to the smooth overlap of atomic positions power spectrum, but also in real space, corresponding to n-body correlations of the atom density. This formalism lays the foundations for a more systematic tuning of the behavior of the representations, by introducing operators that represent the correlations between structure, composition, and the target properties. It provides a unifying picture of recent developments in the ﬁeld and indicates a way forward toward more effective and computationally affordable machine-learning schemes for molecules and materials.},

To this end, a variational principle is derived that is based on the maximization of a Rayleigh coeﬃcient. It is shown that this Rayleigh coeﬃcient can be estimated from statistical observables that can be obtained from short distributed simulations starting from diﬀerent parts of state space. The approach forms a basis for the development of adaptive and eﬃcient computational algorithms for simulating and analyzing metastable Markov processes while avoiding the sampling problem. Since any stochastic process with ﬁnite memory can be transformed into a Markov process, the approach is applicable to a wide range of processes relevant for modeling complex real-world phenomena.},

Often, lipid selfassemblies such as vesicles are also present intracellularly or in commercial formulations. A systematic understanding of how phospholipid vesicles interact with diﬀerent complex coacervates could provide insight and improve control over these systems. In this manuscript, anionic phospholipid vesicles were added to a series of diﬀerent complex coacervate samples in which coacervates were formed by mixing one of ﬁve polycations with one of three (poly)anions that varied in chemical structure and length. Vesicles were found to assemble at the coacervate/continuous phase interface and/or form aggregates. We report how factors such as the charge density of polyelectrolytes and the charge ratio of cationic-to-anionic moieties impact the vesicle distribution in coacervate samples. Our ﬁndings emphasize the importance of interactions between vesicles and polycations in the dilute supernatant phase for determining whether the vesicles aggregate prior to assembly at the liquid−liquid interface. The uptake of an RNA oligonucleotide (A15) was also investigated to understand the eﬀect of these liposome coatings on diﬀusion into coacervate droplets. Systems in which uniform vesicle coronas assemble around coacervate droplets without restricting the entry of biomolecules such as RNAs could be of interest as bioreactors.},

Recent studies show that NMCs sequester RNA and enhance ribozyme reactions, a critical tenet of the RNA World Hypothesis. As RNA is negatively charged, it is expected to interact with polycationic coacervate components. The molecular basis for how identity and concentration of polyanionic components of complex coacervates aﬀect ribozyme catalysis remains unexplored. We report here a general mechanism wherein diverse polyanions enhance ribozyme catalysis in complex coacervates. By competing for unproductive RNA-polycation interactions, polyanions enhance ribozyme reaction more than 12-fold. The generality of our ﬁndings is supported by similar behavior in three polyanionspolycarboxylates, polysulfates, and polysulfates/carboxylatesas well as two diﬀerent ribozymes, the hammerhead and hairpin.

By deﬁning a class of models with multiple species of particles and transmutation between species we can recreate such dynamics. These models admit exact analytical results whilst also forming a counterpart to previous continuum models of run-and-tumble dynamics. We solve the externally driven non-interacting and zero-range versions of the model exactly and utilize a ﬁeld-theoretic approach to derive the continuum ﬂuctuating hydrodynamics for more general interactions. We make contact with prior approaches to run-and-tumble dynamics oﬀ lattice and determine the steady state and linear stability for a class of crowding interactions, where the jump rate decreases as density increases. In addition to its interest from the perspective of nonequilibrium statistical mechanics, this lattice model constitutes an eﬃcient tool to simulate a class of interacting run-and-tumble models relevant to bacterial motion, so long as certain conditions (that we derive) are met.},

Examples range from suspensions of self-propelled bacteria with birth-death dynamics, to bio-molecular condensates, or ‘membraneless organelles’, within cells. In contrast to their passive counterparts, such systems have conserved and non-conserved dynamics that do not, in general, derive from a shared free energy. This mismatch breaks time-reversal symmetry and leads to new types of dynamical competition that are absent in or near equilibrium. We construct a canonical scalar ﬁeld theory to describe such systems, with conserved and non-conserved dynamics obeying Model B and Model A respectively (in the Hohenberg-Halperin classiﬁcation), chosen such that the two free energies involved are incompatible. The resulting minimal model is shown to capture the various phenomenologies reported previously for more complicated models with the same physical ingredients, including microphase separation, limit cycles and droplet splitting. We ﬁnd a low-dimensional subspace of parameters for which time-reversal symmetry is accidentally recovered, and show that here the dynamics of the order parameter ﬁeld (but not its conserved current) is exactly the same as an equilibrium system in which microphase separation is caused by long-range attractive interactions.},

To protect and stabilize their cargo, it is essential to control their exchange dynamics. Yet, to date, little is known about the kinetic stability of C3Ms and the dynamic equilibrium of molecular building blocks with micellar species. Here we study the C3M exchange during the initial micellization by using Langevin dynamics simulations. In this way, we show that charge neutral heterocomplexes consisting of multiple building blocks are the primary mediator for exchange. In addition, we show that the kinetic stability of the C3Ms can be tuned not only by the electrostatic interaction but also by the nonelectrostatic attraction between the polyelectrolytes, the polyelectrolyte length ratio, and the overall polyelectrolyte length. These insights oﬀer new rational design guides to aid the development of new C3M encapsulation strategies.},

This paper introduces a deep learning-based approach that can handle general high-dimensional parabolic PDEs. To this end, the PDEs are reformulated using backward stochastic diﬀerential equations and the gradient of the unknown solution is approximated by neural networks, very much in the spirit of deep reinforcement learning with the gradient acting as the policy function. Numerical results on examples including the nonlinear Black-Scholes equation, the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, and the Allen-Cahn equation suggest that the proposed algorithm is quite eﬀective in high dimensions, in terms of both accuracy and cost. This opens up new possibilities in economics, ﬁnance, operational research, and physics, by considering all participating agents, assets, resources, or particles together at the same time, instead of making ad hoc assumptions on their inter-relationships.},

The standard unbiased technique for evaluating a policy is to deploy the policy and observe its performance. We show that the data collected from deploying a different policy, commonly called the behavior policy, can be used to produce unbiased estimates with lower mean squared error than this standard technique. We derive an analytic expression for the optimal behavior policy—the behavior policy that minimizes the mean squared error of the resulting estimates. Because this expression depends on terms that are unknown in practice, we propose a novel policy evaluation sub-problem, behavior policy search: searching for a behavior policy that reduces mean squared error. We present a behavior policy search algorithm and empirically demonstrate its effectiveness in lowering the mean squared error of policy performance estimates.},

Thus, our approach provides natural ways to compare, interpolate, and average Gaussian mixture models. Moreover, the approach has low computational complexity. Different aspects of the framework are discussed, and examples are presented for illustration purposes.},

            Coronavirus particles are enveloped and pleomorphic and are thus refractory to crystallization and symmetry-assisted reconstruction. A novel methodology of single-particle image analysis was applied to selected virus features to obtain a detailed model of the oligomeric state and spatial relationships among viral structural proteins. Two-dimensional images of the S, M, and N structural proteins of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and two other coronaviruses were refined to a resolution of ∼4 nm. Proteins near the viral membrane were arranged in overlapping lattices surrounding a disordered core. Trimeric glycoprotein spikes were in register with four underlying ribonucleoprotein densities. However, the spikes were dispensable for ribonucleoprotein lattice formation. The ribonucleoprotein particles displayed coiled shapes when released from the viral membrane. Our results contribute to the understanding of the assembly pathway used by coronaviruses and other pleomorphic viruses and provide the first detailed view of coronavirus ultrastructure.},

	abstract = {Multilayer neural networks are among the most powerful models in machine learning, yet the fundamental reasons for this success defy mathematical understanding. Learning a neural network requires optimizing a nonconvex high-dimensional objective (risk function), a problem that is usually attacked using stochastic gradient descent (SGD). Does SGD converge to a global optimum of the risk or only to a local optimum? In the former case, does this happen because local minima are absent or because SGD somehow avoids them? In the latter, why do local minima reached by SGD have good generalization properties? In this paper, we consider a simple case, namely two-layer neural networks, and prove that—in a suitable scaling limit—SGD dynamics is captured by a certain nonlinear partial differential equation (PDE) that we call distributional dynamics (DD). We then consider several specific examples and show how DD can be used to prove convergence of SGD to networks with nearly ideal generalization error. This description allows for “averaging out” some of the complexities of the landscape of neural networks and can be used to prove a general convergence result for noisy SGD.},

We show how the rates of droplet generation and dissolution can be tuned by varying the enzyme and substrate concentrations, and we support our findings with a kinetic model of the underlying enzymatic reaction network. As all steps of the coacervate droplet life cycle, including nucleation, coarsening, and dissolution, occur under the same reaction conditions, the cycle can be repeated multiple times. In addition, by carefully balancing the rates of both enzymatic reactions, our system can be programmed to either form or dissolve droplets at specified times, acting as a chemical timer.},

However, their intrinsic membrane-free nature results in instability that limits their application in protocell research. Herein, we present the development of a new protocell model through the spontaneous interfacial self-assembly of copolymer molecules on biopolymer coacervate microdroplets. This hierarchical protocell model not only incorporates the favorable properties of coacervates (such as spontaneous assembly and macromolecular condensation) but also assimilates the essential features of a semipermeable copolymeric membrane (such as discretization and stabilization). This was accomplished by engineering an asymmetric, biodegradable triblock copolymer molecule comprising hydrophilic, hydrophobic, and polyanionic components capable of direct coacervate membranization via electrostatic surface anchoring and chain selfassociation. The resulting hierarchical protocell demonstrated striking integrity as a result of membrane formation, successfully stabilizing enzymatic cargo against coalescence and fusion in discrete protocellular populations. The semipermeable nature of the copolymeric membrane enabled the incorporation of a simple enzymatic cascade, demonstrating chemical communication between discrete populations of neighboring protocells. In this way, we pave the way for the development of new synthetic cell constructs.},

We discuss here the theoretical underpinnings and history of coarse-graining and summarize the state of the ﬁeld, organizing key methodologies based on an emerging paradigm for multiscale theory and modeling of biomolecular systems. This framework involves an integrated, iterative approach to couple information from different scales. The primary steps, which coincide with key areas of method development, include developing ﬁrst-pass coarse-grained models guided by experimental results, performing numerous large-scale coarsegrained simulations, identifying important interactions that drive emergent behaviors, and ﬁnally reconnecting to the molecular scale by performing all-atom molecular dynamics simulations guided by the coarse-grained results. The coarse-grained modeling can then be extended and reﬁned, with the entire loop repeated iteratively if necessary.},

We also show that this behavior is not so much due to over-parameterization than to a choice of scaling, often implicit, that allows to linearize the model around its initialization. These theoretical results complemented with simple numerical experiments make it seem unlikely that “lazy training” is behind the many successes of neural networks in high dimensional tasks.},

	abstract = {Breakthroughs in machine learning are rapidly changing science and society, yet our fundamental understanding of this technology has lagged far behind. Indeed, one of the central tenets of the field, the bias–variance trade-off, appears to be at odds with the observed behavior of methods used in modern machine-learning practice. The bias–variance trade-off implies that a model should balance underfitting and overfitting: Rich enough to express underlying structure in data and simple enough to avoid fitting spurious patterns. However, in modern practice, very rich models such as neural networks are trained to exactly fit (i.e., interpolate) the data. Classically, such models would be considered overfitted, and yet they often obtain high accuracy on test data. This apparent contradiction has raised questions about the mathematical foundations of machine learning and their relevance to practitioners. In this paper, we reconcile the classical understanding and the modern practice within a unified performance curve. This “double-descent” curve subsumes the textbook U-shaped bias–variance trade-off curve by showing how increasing model capacity beyond the point of interpolation results in improved performance. We provide evidence for the existence and ubiquity of double descent for a wide spectrum of models and datasets, and we posit a mechanism for its emergence. This connection between the performance and the structure of machine-learning models delineates the limits of classical analyses and has implications for both the theory and the practice of machine learning.},

Our work is based on non-linear independent components estimation (NICE), which we extend in numerous ways to improve performance and enable its application to integration problems. First, we introduce piecewise-polynomial coupling transforms that greatly increase the modeling power of individual coupling layers. Second, we propose to preprocess the inputs of neural networks using one-blob encoding, which stimulates localization of computation and improves inference. Third, we derive a gradient-descent-based optimization for the KL and the \${\textbackslash}chi{\textasciicircum}2\$ divergence for the specific application of Monte Carlo integration with unnormalized stochastic estimates of the target distribution. Our approach enables fast and accurate inference and efficient sample generation independently of the dimensionality of the integration domain. We show its benefits on generating natural images and in two applications to light-transport simulation: first, we demonstrate learning of joint path-sampling densities in the primary sample space and importance sampling of multi-dimensional path prefixes thereof. Second, we use our technique to extract conditional directional densities driven by the product of incident illumination and the BSDF in the rendering equation, and we leverage the densities for path guiding. In all applications, our approach yields on-par or higher performance than competing techniques at equal sample count.},

In this paper we lay the basic groundwork for these models, proposing methods for inference, optimization and learning, and analyze their representational power. We show that many existing neural network architectures can be made inputconvex with a minor modiﬁcation, and develop specialized optimization algorithms tailored to this setting. Finally, we highlight the performance of the methods on multi-label prediction, image completion, and reinforcement learning problems, where we show improvement over the existing state of the art in many cases.},

	abstract = {One of the key challenges in automated synthesis planning is to generate diverse and reliable chemical reactions. Many reactions can be naturally represented using graph transformation rules referred broadly to as reaction templates. Using reaction templates enables accurate and interpretable predictions but can suffer from limited coverage of the reaction space. On the other hand, template-free methods can increase the coverage but can be prone to making trivial mistakes and are challenging to interpret. A promising idea for constructing more interpretable template-free models is to model a reaction as a sequence of graph edits of the substrates. We extend this idea to retrosynthesis and scale it up to large datasets. We propose Molecule Edit Graph Attention Network (MEGAN), a template-free neural model that encodes reaction as a sequence of graph edits. We achieve competitive performance on both retrosynthesis and forward synthesis and in particular state-of-the-art top-k accuracy for larger K values. Crucially, the latter shows excellent coverage of the reaction space of our model. In summary, MEGAN brings together the strong elements of template-free and template-based models and can be applied to both retro and forward synthesis tasks.},

The spectral graph wavelets are then formed by localizing this operator by applying it to an indicator function. Subject to an admissibility condition on g, this procedure deﬁnes an invertible transform. We explore the localization properties of the wavelets in the limit of ﬁne scales. Additionally, we present a fast Chebyshev polynomial approximation algorithm for computing the transform that avoids the need for diagonalizing L.

We demonstrate in human peripheral blood mononuclear cells that CART vaccines can activate a robust antigen-specific immune response against mRNA-encoded viral epitopes. In an established mouse model, we demonstrate that CARTs preferentially target professional APCs in secondary lymphoid organs upon i.v. injections and target local APCs upon s.c. injection. Finally, we show that CARTs coformulated with mRNA and a Toll-like receptor ligand simultaneously transfect and activate target cells to generate an immune response that can treat and cure mice with large, established tumors.},

Composed of lipid-containing oligocarbonates and cationic oligo(serine esters), SerCARTs are readily prepared (one ﬂask) by a mild ringopening polymerization using thiourea anions and, upon simple mixing with mRNA, readily form complexes that degrade to neutral serine-based products, eﬃciently releasing their mRNA cargo. mRNA/Ser-CART transfection eﬃciencies of {\textgreater}95\% are achieved in vitro. Intramuscular or intravenous (iv) injections of mRNA/ Ser-CARTs into living mice result in in vivo expression of a luciferase reporter protein, with spleen localization observed after iv injection.},

	abstract = {We report a strategy for generating a combinatorial library of oligonucleotide transporters with varied lipid domains and their use in the efficient transfection of lymphocytes with mRNA in vitro and in vivo. This library is based on amphiphilic charge-altering releasable transporters (CARTs) that contain a lipophilic block functionalized with various side-chain lipids and a polycationic α-amino ester mRNA-binding block that undergoes rearrangement to neutral small molecules, resulting in mRNA release. We show that certain binary mixtures of these lipid-varied CARTs provide up to a ninefold enhancement in mRNA translation in lymphocytes in vitro relative to either a single-lipid CART component alone or the commercial reagent Lipofectamine 2000, corresponding to a striking increase in percent transfection from 9–12\% to 80\%. Informed by the results with binary mixtures, we further show that CARTs consisting of optimized ratios of the two lead lipids incorporated into a single hybrid-lipid transporter molecule maintain the same delivery efficacy as the noncovalent mixture of two CARTs. The lead lipid CART mixtures and hybrid-lipid CARTs show enhanced lymphocyte transfection in primary T cells and in vivo in mice. This combinatorial approach for rapidly screening mRNA delivery vectors has provided lipid-varied CART mixtures and hybrid-lipid CARTs that exhibit significant improvement in mRNA delivery to lymphocytes, a finding of potentially broad value in research and clinical applications.},

Lipid variations of the CARTs substantially impacted the delivery eﬃciency of pDNA, with oleyl- and linoleyl-based CARTs showing enhanced performance relative to the commercial transfection agent Lipofectamine 2000 (L2000). The best-performing oleyl CART was carried forward to study stable luciferase transfection with a Sleeping Beauty (SB) transposon system.

Here we report the step-economical synthesis and evaluation of a tunable and effective class of synthetic biodegradable materials: charge-altering releasable transporters (CARTs) for mRNA delivery into cells. CARTs are structurally unique and operate through an unprecedented mechanism, serving initially as oligo(α-amino ester) cations that complex, protect, and deliver mRNA and then change physical properties through a degradative, charge-neutralizing intramolecular rearrangement, leading to intracellular release of functional mRNA and highly efficient protein translation. With demonstrated utility in both cultured cells and animals, this mRNA delivery technology should be broadly applicable to numerous research and therapeutic applications.},

The convergence behavior and statistical properties of these approaches are often poorly understood because of the nonconvex nature of the underlying optimization problems as well as the lack of exact gradient computation. In this paper, we take a step towards demystifying the performance and efﬁciency of such methods by focusing on the standard inﬁnite-horizon linear quadratic regulator problem for continuous-time systems with unknown state-space parameters. We establish exponential stability for the ordinary differential equation (ODE) that governs the gradient-ﬂow dynamics over the set of stabilizing feedback gains and show that a similar result holds for the gradient descent method that arises from the forward Euler discretization of the corresponding ODE. We also provide theoretical bounds on the convergence rate and sample complexity of a random search method. Our results demonstrate that the required simulation time for achieving -accuracy in a model-free setup and the total number of function evaluations both scale as log (1/ ).},

While energy is the elementary quantity governing physical dynamics, entropy is the fundamental concept in information theory. In this work, starting from first principles, we give a detailed didactic account on the relations between energy and entropy and thus physics and information theory. We show that thermodynamic process inequalities, like the second law, are equivalent to the requirement that an effective description for physical dynamics is strongly relaxing. From the perspective of information theory, strongly relaxing dynamics govern the irreversible convergence of a statistical ensemble towards the maximally non-commital probability distribution that is compatible with thermodynamic equilibrium parameters. In particular, Markov processes that converge to a thermodynamic equilibrium state are strongly relaxing. Our framework generalizes previous results to arbitrary open and driven systems, yielding novel thermodynamic bounds for idealized and real processes.},

We study the response of an observable to a perturbation of the underlying stochastic dynamics. We find that the magnitude of the response is bounded from above by the fluctuations of the observable in the unperturbed system and the Kullback–Leibler divergence between the probability densities describing the perturbed and the unperturbed system. This establishes a connection between linear response and concepts of information theory. We show that in many physical situations, the relative entropy may be expressed in terms of physical observables. As a direct consequence of this FRI, we show that for steady-state particle transport, the differential mobility is bounded by the diffusivity. For a “virtual” perturbation proportional to the local mean velocity, we recover the thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) for steady-state transport processes. Finally, we use the FRI to derive a generalization of the uncertainty relation to arbitrary dynamics, which involves higher-order cumulants of the observable. We provide an explicit example, in which the TUR is violated but its generalization is satisfied with equality.},

We apply the deﬁnition of transport eciency to steady state particle transport and heat engines and show that the transport eciency may approach unity at ﬁnite current, in contrast to the thermodynamic eciency.

However, despite considerable eﬀort by the community in these areas, and due to the inherent technical diﬃculty of the problem, there is virtually no existing work combining the power of importance sampling with the strength of minibatching. In this paper we propose the ﬁrst practical importance sampling for minibatches and give simple and rigorous complexity analysis of its performance.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00551},
	abstract = {We consider the problem of sampling from a density of the form \$p(x) {\textbackslash}propto {\textbackslash}exp(-f(x)- g(x))\$, where \$f: {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$ is a smooth and strongly convex function and \$g: {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}{\textasciicircum}d {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}mathbb\{R\}\$ is a convex and Lipschitz function. We propose a new algorithm based on the Metropolis-Hastings framework, and prove that it mixes to within TV distance \${\textbackslash}varepsilon\$ of the target density in at most \$O(d {\textbackslash}log (d/{\textbackslash}varepsilon))\$ iterations. This guarantee extends previous results on sampling from distributions with smooth log densities (\$g = 0\$) to the more general composite non-smooth case, with the same mixing time up to a multiple of the condition number. Our method is based on a novel proximal-based proposal distribution that can be efficiently computed for a large class of non-smooth functions \$g\$.},

	abstract = {Optimization algorithms and Monte Carlo sampling algorithms have provided the computational foundations for the rapid growth in applications of statistical machine learning in recent years. There is, however, limited theoretical understanding of the relationships between these 2 kinds of methodology, and limited understanding of relative strengths and weaknesses. Moreover, existing results have been obtained primarily in the setting of convex functions (for optimization) and log-concave functions (for sampling). In this setting, where local properties determine global properties, optimization algorithms are unsurprisingly more efficient computationally than sampling algorithms. We instead examine a class of nonconvex objective functions that arise in mixture modeling and multistable systems. In this nonconvex setting, we find that the computational complexity of sampling algorithms scales linearly with the model dimension while that of optimization algorithms scales exponentially.},

	abstract = {Importance sampling has been successfully used to accelerate stochastic optimization in many convex problems. However, the lack of an efficient way to calculate the importance still hinders its application to Deep Learning. In this paper, we show that the loss value can be used as an alternative importance metric, and propose a way to efficiently approximate it for a deep model, using a small model trained for that purpose in parallel. This method allows in particular to utilize a biased gradient estimate that implicitly optimizes a soft max-loss, and leads to better generalization performance. While such method suffers from a prohibitively high variance of the gradient estimate when using a standard stochastic optimizer, we show that when it is combined with our sampling mechanism, it results in a reliable procedure. We showcase the generality of our method by testing it on both image classification and language modeling tasks using deep convolutional and recurrent neural networks. In particular, our method results in 30\% faster training of a CNN for CIFAR10 than when using uniform sampling.},

This model, however, was originally designed to be learned with the presence of both training and test data. Moreover, the recursive neighborhood expansion across layers poses time and memory challenges for training with large, dense graphs. To relax the requirement of simultaneous availability of test data, we interpret graph convolutions as integral transforms of embedding functions under probability measures. Such an interpretation allows for the use of Monte Carlo approaches to consistently estimate the integrals, which in turn leads to a batched training scheme as we propose in this work---FastGCN. Enhanced with importance sampling, FastGCN not only is efficient for training but also generalizes well for inference. We show a comprehensive set of experiments to demonstrate its effectiveness compared with GCN and related models. In particular, training is orders of magnitude more efficient while predictions remain comparably accurate.},

Computing the underlying structure and dynamics of such complex systems is extremely difficult due to the combinatorial explosion of their state space. Here, we develop deep generative continuous spin-glass distributions with normalizing flows to model correlations in generic discrete problems. We use a self-supervised learning paradigm by automatically generating the data from the spin-glass itself. We demonstrate that key physical and computational properties of the spin-glass phase can be successfully learned, including multi-modal steady-state distributions and topological structures among metastable states. Remarkably, we observe that the learning itself corresponds to a spin-glass phase transition within the layers of the trained normalizing flows. The inverse normalizing flows learns to perform reversible multi-scale coarse-graining operations which are very different from the typical irreversible renormalization group techniques.},

They have been successfully applied to a myriad of domains including chemistry, physics, social sciences, knowledge graphs, recommendation, and neuroscience. As the field grows, it becomes critical to identify the architectures and key mechanisms which generalize across graphs sizes, enabling us to tackle larger, more complex datasets and domains. Unfortunately, it has been increasingly difficult to gauge the effectiveness of new GNNs and compare models in the absence of a standardized benchmark with consistent experimental settings and large datasets. In this paper, we propose a reproducible GNN benchmarking framework, with the facility for researchers to add new datasets and models conveniently. We apply this benchmarking framework to novel medium-scale graph datasets from mathematical modeling, computer vision, chemistry and combinatorial problems to establish key operations when designing effective GNNs. Precisely, graph convolutions, anisotropic diffusion, residual connections and normalization layers are universal building blocks for developing robust and scalable GNNs.},

	abstract = {We propose a simple auto-encoder framework for molecule generation. The molecular graph is first encoded into a continuous latent representation \$z\$, which is then decoded back to a molecule. The encoding process is easy, but the decoding process remains challenging. In this work, we introduce a simple two-step decoding process. In a first step, a fully connected neural network uses the latent vector \$z\$ to produce a molecular formula, for example CO\$\_2\$ (one carbon and two oxygen atoms). In a second step, a graph convolutional neural network uses the same latent vector \$z\$ to place bonds between the atoms that were produced in the first step (for example a double bond will be placed between the carbon and each of the oxygens). This two-step process, in which a bag of atoms is first generated, and then assembled, provides a simple framework that allows us to develop an efficient molecule auto-encoder. Numerical experiments on basic tasks such as novelty, uniqueness, validity and optimized chemical property for the 250k ZINC molecules demonstrate the performances of the proposed system. Particularly, we achieve the highest reconstruction rate of 90.5{\textbackslash}\%, improving the previous rate of 76.7{\textbackslash}\%.

While their expressiveness is the reason they succeed, it also causes them to learn uninterpretable solutions that could have counter-intuitive properties. In this paper we report two such properties. First, we find that there is no distinction between individual high level units and random linear combinations of high level units, according to various methods of unit analysis. It suggests that it is the space, rather than the individual units, that contains of the semantic information in the high layers of neural networks. Second, we find that deep neural networks learn input-output mappings that are fairly discontinuous to a significant extend. We can cause the network to misclassify an image by applying a certain imperceptible perturbation, which is found by maximizing the network's prediction error. In addition, the specific nature of these perturbations is not a random artifact of learning: the same perturbation can cause a different network, that was trained on a different subset of the dataset, to misclassify the same input.},

The IAF is trained to minimize the KL divergence from an isotropic Gaussian to the warped posterior, and then HMC sampling is performed in the warped space.

Particularly, we can write the second law in standard form, with the only difference that heat currents must be defined with respect to the reservoir.

	abstract = {Optimal transport is a foundational problem in optimization, that allows to compare probability distributions while taking into account geometric aspects. Its optimal objective value, the Wasserstein distance, provides an important loss between distributions that has been used in many applications throughout machine learning and statistics. Recent algorithmic progress on this problem and its regularized versions have made these tools increasingly popular. However, existing techniques require solving an optimization problem to obtain a single gradient of the loss, thus slowing down ﬁrst-order methods to minimize the sum of losses, that require many such gradient computations. In this work, we introduce an algorithm to solve a regularized version of this problem of Wasserstein estimators, with a time per step which is sublinear in the natural dimensions of the problem. We introduce a dual formulation, and optimize it with stochastic gradient steps that can be computed directly from samples, without solving additional optimization problems at each step. Doing so, the estimation and computation tasks are performed jointly. We show that this algorithm can be extended to other tasks, including estimation of Wasserstein barycenters. We provide theoretical guarantees and illustrate the performance of our algorithm with experiments on synthetic data.},

One of the most fundamental processes in this regard is the solvation of hydrophobic solutes in water. The vast majority of theoretical and numerical studies examine density ﬂuctuations at the short length scale focusing exclusively on spherical cavities. In this work, we use both ﬁrst-principles and classical molecular dynamics simulations to demonstrate that density ﬂuctuations in liquid water can deviate signiﬁcantly from the canonical spherical shapes. We show that regions of empty space are frequently characterized by exotic, highly asymmetric shapes that can be quite delocalized over the hydrogen bond network. Interestingly, density ﬂuctuations of these shapes are characterized by Gaussian statistics with larger ﬂuctuations. An important consequence of this is that the work required to create non spherical cavities can be substantially smaller than that of spheres. This feature is also qualitatively captured by the Lum−Chandler−Weeks theory. The scaling behavior of the free energy as a function of the volume at short length scales is qualitatively diﬀerent for the nonspherical entities. We also demonstrate that nonspherical density ﬂuctuations are important for accommodating the hydrophobic amino acid alanine and are thus likely to have signiﬁcant implications when it comes to solvating highly asymmetrical species such as alkanes, polymers, or biomolecules.},

	abstract = {Neural networks trained to minimize the logistic (a.k.a. cross-entropy) loss with gradient-based methods are observed to perform well in many supervised classiﬁcation tasks. Towards understanding this phenomenon, we analyze the training and generalization behavior of inﬁnitely wide two-layer neural networks with homogeneous activations. We show that the limits of the gradient ﬂow on exponentially tailed losses can be fully characterized as a max-margin classiﬁer in a certain non-Hilbertian space of functions. In presence of hidden low-dimensional structures, the resulting margin is independent of the ambiant dimension, which leads to strong generalization bounds. In contrast, training only the output layer implicitly solves a kernel support vector machine, which a priori does not enjoy such an adaptivity. Our analysis of training is non-quantitative in terms of running time but we prove computational guarantees in simpliﬁed settings by showing equivalences with online mirror descent. Finally, numerical experiments suggest that our analysis describes well the practical behavior of two-layer neural networks with ReLU activation and conﬁrm the statistical beneﬁts of this implicit bias.},

Roughly speaking, we are concerned with situations that involve a very large number of “rational players” with a limited information (or visibility) on the “game”. Each player chooses his optimal strategy in view of the global (or macroscopic) informations that are available to him and that result from the actions of all players. In the three examples we mention here, we derive a meanﬁeld problem which consists in nonlinear differential equations. These equations are of a new type and our main goal here is to study them and establish their links with various ﬁelds of Analysis. We show in particular that these nonlinear problems are essentially well-posed problems i.e., have unique solutions. In addition, we give various limiting cases, examples and possible extensions.

It is known that the distribution of generation times obtained from a single lineage is, in general, insufficient to determine a population's growth rate. Is there an explicit relationship between observables obtained from a single lineage and the population growth rate? We show that a population's growth rate can be represented in terms of averages over isolated lineages. This lineage representation is related to a large deviation principle that is a generic feature of exponentially proliferating populations. Due to the large deviation structure of growing populations, the number of lineages needed to obtain an accurate estimate of the growth rate depends exponentially on the duration of the lineages, leading to a non-monotonic convergence of the estimate, which we verify in both synthetic and experimental data sets.},

	abstract = {We develop connections between Stein’s approximation method, logarithmic Sobolev and transport inequalities by introducing a new class of functional inequalities involving the relative entropy, the Stein kernel, the relative Fisher information and the Wasserstein distance with respect to a given reference distribution on Rd. For the Gaussian model, the results improve upon the classical logarithmic Sobolev inequality and the Talagrand quadratic transportation cost inequality. Further examples of illustrations include multidimensional gamma distributions, beta distributions, as well as families of log-concave densities. As a by-product, the new inequalities are shown to be relevant towards convergence to equilibrium, concentration inequalities and entropic convergence expressed in terms of the Stein kernel. The tools rely on semigroup interpolation and bounds, in particular by means of the iterated gradients of the Markov generator with invariant measure the distribution under consideration. In a second part, motivated by the recent investigation by Nourdin, Peccati and Swan on Wiener chaoses, we address the issue of entropic bounds on multidimensional functionals F with the Stein kernel via a set of data on F and its gradients rather than on the Fisher information of the density. A natural framework for this investigation is given by the Markov Triple structure (E, µ, Γ) in which abstract Malliavin-type arguments may be developed and extend the Wiener chaos setting.},

Modeling physics system, learning molecular ﬁngerprints, predicting protein interface, and classifying diseases require a model to learn from graph inputs. In other domains such as learning from non-structural data like texts and images, reasoning on extracted structures, like the dependency tree of sentences and the scene graph of images, is an important research topic which also needs graph reasoning models. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are connectionist models that capture the dependence of graphs via message passing between the nodes of graphs. Unlike standard neural networks, graph neural networks retain a state that can represent information from its neighborhood with arbitrary depth. Although the primitive GNNs have been found difﬁcult to train for a ﬁxed point, recent advances in network architectures, optimization techniques, and parallel computation have enabled successful learning with them. In recent years, systems based on variants of graph neural networks such as graph convolutional network (GCN), graph attention network (GAT), gated graph neural network (GGNN) have demonstrated ground-breaking performance on many tasks mentioned above. In this survey, we provide a detailed review over existing graph neural network models, systematically categorize the applications, and propose four open problems for future research.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1912.13053},
	abstract = {A fundamental goal in deep learning is the characterization of trainability and generalization of neural networks as a function of their architecture and hyperparameters. In this paper, we discuss these challenging issues in the context of wide neural networks at large depths where we will see that the situation simpliﬁes considerably. To do this, we leverage recent advances that have separately shown: (1) that in the wide network limit, random networks before training are Gaussian Processes governed by a kernel known as the Neural Network Gaussian Process (NNGP) kernel, (2) that at large depths the spectrum of the NNGP kernel simpliﬁes considerably and becomes “weakly data-dependent”, and (3) that gradient descent training of wide neural networks is described by a kernel called the Neural Tangent Kernel (NTK) that is related to the NNGP. Here we show that in the large depth limit the spectrum of the NTK simpliﬁes in much the same way as that of the NNGP kernel. By analyzing this spectrum, we arrive at a precise characterization of trainability and a necessary condition for generalization across a range of architectures including Fully Connected Networks (FCNs) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). In particular, we ﬁnd that there are large regions of hyperparameter space where networks can only memorize the training set in the sense they reach perfect training accuracy but completely fail to generalize outside the training set, in contrast with several recent results. By comparing CNNs with- and without-global average pooling, we show that CNNs without average pooling have very nearly identical learning dynamics to FCNs while CNNs with pooling contain a correction that alters its generalization performance. We perform a thorough empirical investigation of these theoretical results and ﬁnding excellent agreement on real datasets.},

Here, we study the performance of QAOA on the MaxCut combinatorial optimization problem, optimizing the quantum circuits on a classical computer using automatic differentiation and stochastic gradient descent, using QuantumFlow, a quantum circuit simulator implemented with TensorFlow. We find that we can amortize the training cost by optimizing on batches of problems instances; that QAOA can exceed the performance of the classical polynomial time Goemans-Williamson algorithm with modest circuit depth, and that performance with fixed circuit depth is insensitive to problem size. Moreover, MaxCut QAOA can be efficiently implemented on a gate-based quantum computer with limited qubit connectivity, using a qubit swap network. These observations support the prospects that QAOA will be an effective method for solving interesting problems on near-term quantum computers.},

	abstract = {We introduce a quantum neural network, QNN, that can represent labeled data, classical or quantum, and be trained by supervised learning. The quantum circuit consists of a sequence of parameter dependent unitary transformations which acts on an input quantum state. For binary classiﬁcation a single Pauli operator is measured on a designated readout qubit. The measured output is the quantum neural network’s predictor of the binary label of the input state. First we look at classifying classical data sets which consist of n-bit strings with binary labels. The input quantum state is an n-bit computational basis state corresponding to a sample string. We show how to design a circuit made from two qubit unitaries that can correctly represent the label of any Boolean function of n bits. For certain label functions the circuit is exponentially long. We introduce parameter dependent unitaries that can be adapted by supervised learning of labeled data. We study an example of real world data consisting of downsampled images of handwritten digits each of which has been labeled as one of two distinct digits. We show through classical simulation that parameters can be found that allow the QNN to learn to correctly distinguish the two data sets. We then discuss presenting the data as quantum superpositions of computational basis states corresponding to diﬀerent label values. Here we show through simulation that learning is possible. We consider using our QNN to learn the label of a general quantum state. By example we show that this can be done. Our work is exploratory and relies on the classical simulation of small quantum systems. The QNN proposed here was designed with near-term quantum processors in mind. Therefore it will be possible to run this QNN on a near term gate model quantum computer where its power can be explored beyond what can be explored with simulation.},

	abstract = {Cellular functions are established through biological evolution, but are constrained by the laws of physics. For instance, the physics of protein folding limits the lengths of cellular polypeptide chains. Consequently, many cellular functions are carried out not by long, isolated proteins, but rather by multiprotein complexes. Protein complexes themselves do not escape physical constraints, one of the most important being the difficulty of assembling reliably in the presence of cellular noise. In order to lay the foundation for a theory of reliable protein complex assembly, we study here an equilibrium thermodynamic model of self-assembly that exhibits 4 distinct assembly behaviors: diluted protein solution, liquid mixture, “chimeric assembly,” and “multifarious assembly.” In the latter regime, different protein complexes can coexist without forming erroneous chimeric structures. We show that 2 conditions have to be fulfilled to attain this regime: 1) The composition of the complexes needs to be sufficiently heterogeneous, and 2) the use of the set of components by the complexes has to be sparse. Our analysis of publicly available databases of protein complexes indicates that cellular protein systems might have indeed evolved so as to satisfy both of these conditions.},

This relation implies a lower bound on the dissipation for any diffusion process in terms of its initial and final state. Using a lower bound on the Wasserstein distance, we further show that we can give a lower bound on the dissipation in terms of only the mean and convariance matrix of the initial and final state. We apply this result to derive the optimal forces that minimize the dissipation for given initial and final mean and covariance.},

	abstract = {The molecular origin of standard metabolic rate and thermogenesis in mammals is examined. It is pointed out that there are important differences and distinctions between the cellular reactions that 1) couple to oxygen consumption, 2) uncouple metabolism, 3) hydrolyze ATP, 4) control metabolic rate, 5) regulate metabolic rate, 6) produce heat, and 7) dissipate free energy. The quantitative contribution of different cellular reactions to these processes is assessed in mammals. We estimate that approximately 90\% of mammalian oxygen consumption in the standard state is mitochondrial, of which approximately 20\% is uncoupled by the mitochondrial proton leak and 80\% is coupled to ATP synthesis. The consequences of the significant contribution of proton leak to standard metabolic rate for tissue P-to-O ratio, heat production, and free energy dissipation by oxidative phosphorylation and the estimated contribution of ATP-consuming processes to tissue oxygen consumption rate are discussed. Of the 80\% of oxygen consumption coupled to ATP synthesis, approximately 25-30\% is used by protein synthesis, 19-28\% by the Na(+)-K(+)-ATPase, 4-8\% by the Ca2(+)-ATPase, 2-8\% by the actinomyosin ATPase, 7-10\% by gluconeogenesis, and 3\% by ureagenesis, with mRNA synthesis and substrate cycling also making significant contributions. The main cellular reactions that uncouple standard energy metabolism are the Na+, K+, H+, and Ca2+ channels and leaks of cell membranes and protein breakdown. Cellular metabolic rate is controlled by a number of processes including metabolic demand and substrate supply. The differences in standard metabolic rate between animals of different body mass and phylogeny appear to be due to proportionate changes in the whole of energy metabolism. Heat is produced by some reactions and taken up by others but is mainly produced by the reactions of mitochondrial respiration, oxidative phosphorylation, and proton leak on the inner mitochondrial membrane. Free energy is dissipated by all cellular reactions, but the major contributions are by the ATP-utilizing reactions and the uncoupling reactions. The functions and evolutionary significance of standard metabolic rate are discussed.},

We review recent work in which methods of physical analysis rooted in statistical mechanics have begun to shed conceptual insights into these questions. These insights yield connections between deep learning and diverse physical and mathematical topics, including random landscapes, spin glasses, jamming, dynamical phase transitions, chaos, Riemannian geometry, random matrix theory, free probability, and nonequilibrium statistical mechanics. Indeed, the fields of statistical mechanics and machine learning have long enjoyed a rich history of strongly coupled interactions, and recent advances at the intersection of statistical mechanics and deep learning suggest these interactions will only deepen going forward.},

	abstract = {Schro« dinger stated in his landmark book, What is Life?, that life feeds on negative entropy. In this contribution, the validity of this statement is discussed through a careful thermodynamic analysis of microbial growth processes. In principle, both feeding on negative entropy, i.e. yielding products of higher entropy than the substrates, and generating heat can be used by microorganisms to rid themselves of internal entropy production resulting from maintenance and growth processes. Literature data are reviewed in order to compare these two mechanisms. It is shown that entropy-neutral, entropy-driven, and entropy-retarded growth exist. The analysis of some particularly interesting microorganisms shows that enthalpyretarded microbial growth may also exist, which would signify a net uptake of heat during growth. However, the existence of endothermic life has never been demonstrated in a calorimeter. The internal entropy production in live cells also reflects itself in the Gibbs energy dissipation accompanying growth, which is related quantitatively to the biomass yield. An empirical correlation of the Gibbs energy dissipation in terms of the physico-chemical nature of the growth substrate has been proposed in the literature and can be used to predict the biomass yield approximately. The ratio of enthalpy change and Gibbs energy change can also be predicted since it is shown to be approximately equal to the same ratio of the relevant catabolic process alone. ß 1999 Elsevier Science B.V.

We also show that linear distribution estimates, such as the empirical distribution or kernel density estimator, often fail to converge at the optimal rate. Our bounds generalize, unify, or improve several recent and classical results. Moreover, IPMs can be used to formalize a statistical model of generative adversarial networks (GANs).

In particular we are interested in the rate of decay to equilibrium or self-similar solutions. The main analytical tool is based on the analysis of the entropy dissipation. In the scalar case this is done by proving decay of the entropy dissipation rate and bootstrapping back to show convergence of the relative entropy to zero. As by-product, this approach gives generalized Sobolev-inequalities, which interpolate between the Gross logarithmic Sobolev inequality and the classical Sobolev inequality. The time decay of the solutions of the degenerate systems is analyzed by means of a generalisation of the Nash inequality. Porous media, fast diffusion, p-Laplace and energy transport systems are included in the considered class of problems. A generalized CsiszaÂr±Kullback inequality allows for an estimation of the decay to equilibrium in terms of the relative entropy.},

Then, we prove a new risk bound for this minimax problem in terms of covering numbers under a weak version of Lipschitz condition. Our method can be applied to multi-class classiﬁcation problems and commonly used loss functions such as the hinge and ramp losses. As some illustrative examples, we derive the adversarial risk bounds for SVMs, deep neural networks, and PCA, and our bounds have two data-dependent terms, which can be optimized for achieving adversarial robustness.},

	abstract = {This is a series of four lectures presented at the 2015 Enrico Fermi summer school in Varenna. The aim of the lectures is to give an introduction to the hydrodynamics of active matter concentrating on low Reynolds number examples such as cells and molecular motors. Lecture 1 introduces the hydrodynamics of single active particles, covering the Stokes equation and the Scallop Theorem, and stressing the link between autonomous activity and the dipolar symmetry of the far ﬂow ﬁeld. In lecture 2 I discuss applications of this mathematics to the behaviour of microswimmers at surfaces and in external ﬂows, and describe our current understanding of how swimmers stir the surrounding ﬂuid. Lectures 3 concentrates on the collective behaviour of active particles, modelled as an active nematic. I write down the equations of motion and motivate the form of the active stress. The resulting hydrodynamic instability leads to a state termed ‘active turbulence’ characterised by strong jets and vortices in the ﬂow ﬁeld and the continual creation and annihilation of pairs of topological defects. Lecture 4 compares simulations of active turbulence to experiments on suspensions of microtubules and molecular motors. I introduce lyotropic active nematics and discuss active anchoring at interfaces.},

The hyperaccurate current can be used to improve estimates of entropy production from experimental data.},

	abstract = {Generative adversarial networks (GANs) are a novel approach to generative modelling, a task whose goal it is to learn a distribution of real data points. They have often proved difficult to train: GANs are unlike many techniques in machine learning, in that they are best described as a two-player game between a discriminator and generator. This has yielded both unreliability in the training process, and a general lack of understanding as to how GANs converge, and if so, to what. The purpose of this dissertation is to provide an account of the theory of GANs suitable for the mathematician, highlighting both positive and negative results. This involves identifying the problems when training GANs, and how topological and game-theoretic perspectives of GANs have contributed to our understanding and improved our techniques in recent years.},

Methods for the prediction of protein structures from their sequences are now heavily based on machine learning tools. The way simulations are performed to explore the energy landscape of protein systems is also changing as force-ﬁelds are started to be designed by means of machine learning methods. These methods are also used to extract the essential information from large simulation datasets and to enhance the sampling of rare events such as folding/unfolding transitions. While signiﬁcant challenges still need to be tackled, we expect these methods to play an important role on the study of protein folding and dynamics in the near future.

In this paper, we characterize the norm required to realize a function f : Rd → R as a single hidden-layer ReLU network with an unbounded number of units (inﬁnite width), but where the Euclidean norm of the weights is bounded, including precisely characterizing which functions can be realized with ﬁnite norm. This was settled for univariate functions f : R → R in Savarese et al. (2019), where it was shown that the required norm is determined by the L1-norm of the second derivative of the function. We extend the characterization to multi-variate functions (d ≥ 2, i.e., multiple input units), relating the required norm to the L1-norm of the Radon transform of a (d + 1)/2-power Laplacian of the function. This characterization allows us to show that all functions in Sobolev spaces W s,1(Rd), s ≥ d + 1, can be represented with bounded norm, to calculate the required norm for several speciﬁc functions, and to obtain a depth separation result. These results have important implications for understanding generalization performance and the distinction between neural networks and more traditional kernel learning.},

Our ﬁrst main result is the well-posedness of the master equation. To do so, we ﬁrst show the existence and uniqueness of a solution to the “mean ﬁeld game system with common noise”, which consists in a coupled system made of a backward stochastic Hamilton-Jacobi equation and a forward stochastic Kolmogorov equation and which plays the role of characteristics for the master equation. Our second main result is the convergence, in average, of the solution of the Nash system and a propagation of chaos property for the associated “optimal trajectories”.},

	abstract = {We study a general version of the adversarial online learning problem. We are given a decision set X in a reﬂexive Banach space X and a sequence of reward vectors in the dual space of X. At each iteration, we choose an action from X , based on the observed sequence of previous rewards. Our goal is to minimize regret, deﬁned as the gap between the realized reward and the reward of the best ﬁxed action in hindsight. Using results from inﬁnite dimensional convex analysis, we generalize the method of Dual Averaging (or Follow the Regularized Leader) to our setting and obtain general upper bounds on the worst-case regret that subsume a wide range of results from the literature. Under the assumption of uniformly continuous rewards, we obtain explicit anytime regret bounds in a setting where the decision set is the set of probability distributions on a compact metric space S whose Radon-Nikodym derivatives are elements of Lp(S) for some p {\textgreater} 1. Importantly, we make no convexity assumptions on either the set S or the reward functions. We also prove a general lower bound on the worst-case regret for any online algorithm. We then apply these results to the problem of learning in repeated continuous two-player zero-sum games, in which players’ strategy sets are compact metric spaces. In doing so, we ﬁrst prove that if both players play a Hannan-consistent strategy, then with probability 1 the empirical distributions of play weakly converge to the set of Nash equilibria of the game. We then show that, under mild assumptions, Dual Averaging on the (inﬁnite-dimensional) space of probability distributions indeed achieves Hannan-consistency. Finally, we illustrate our results through numerical examples.},

	abstract = {Very deep convolutional networks with hundreds of layers have led to signiﬁcant reductions in error on competitive benchmarks. Although the unmatched expressiveness of the many layers can be highly desirable at test time, training very deep networks comes with its own set of challenges. The gradients can vanish, the forward ﬂow often diminishes, and the training time can be painfully slow. To address these problems, we propose stochastic depth, a training procedure that enables the seemingly contradictory setup to train short networks and use deep networks at test time. We start with very deep networks but during training, for each mini-batch, randomly drop a subset of layers and bypass them with the identity function. This simple approach complements the recent success of residual networks. It reduces training time substantially and improves the test error signiﬁcantly on almost all data sets that we used for evaluation. With stochastic depth we can increase the depth of residual networks even beyond 1200 layers and still yield meaningful improvements in test error (4.91\% on CIFAR-10).},

Under these general assumptions, the normalized random matrix product \$\$Z\_n = (I + {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{n\}X\_n)(I + {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{n\}X\_\{n-1\}) {\textbackslash}cdots (I + {\textbackslash}frac\{1\}\{n\}X\_1)\$\$ converges to \$Z\_n {\textbackslash}rightarrow e{\textasciicircum}\{X\}\$ as \$n {\textbackslash}rightarrow {\textbackslash}infty\$. Normalized random matrix products of this form arise naturally in stochastic iterative algorithms, such as Oja's algorithm for streaming Principal Component Analysis. Here, we derive nonasymptotic concentration inequalities for such random matrix products. In particular, we show that the spectral norm error satisfies \${\textbackslash}{\textbar} Z\_n - e{\textasciicircum}\{X\} {\textbackslash}{\textbar} = O(({\textbackslash}log(n)){\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}log(d/{\textbackslash}delta)/{\textbackslash}sqrt\{n\})\$ with probability exceeding \$1-{\textbackslash}delta\$. This rate is sharp in \$n\$, \$d\$, and \${\textbackslash}delta\$, up to possibly the \${\textbackslash}log(n)\$ and \${\textbackslash}log(d)\$ factors. The proof relies on two key points of theory: the Matrix Bernstein inequality concerning the concentration of sums of random matrices, and Baranyai's theorem from combinatorial mathematics. Concentration bounds for general classes of random matrix products are hard to come by in the literature, and we hope that our result will inspire further work in this direction.},

However, there is a confusing plethora of different neural network methods that are used in the literature and in industry. This paper describes a set of concrete best practices that document analysis researchers can use to get good results with neural networks. The most important practice is getting a training set as large as possible: we expand the training set by adding a new form of distorted data. The next most important practice is that convolutional neural networks are better suited for visual document tasks than fully connected networks. We propose that a simple “do-it-yourself” implementation of convolution with a flexible architecture is suitable for many visual document problems. This simple convolutional neural network does not require complex methods, such as momentum, weight decay, structuredependent learning rates, averaging layers, tangent prop, or even finely-tuning the architecture. The end result is a very simple yet general architecture which can yield state-of-the-art performance for document analysis. We illustrate our claims on the MNIST set of English digit images.},

Given an appropriate network architecture, gradient-based learning algorithms can be used to synthesize a complex decision surface that can classify high-dimensional patterns, such as handwritten characters, with minimal preprocessing. This paper reviews various methods applied to handwritten character recognition and compares them on a standard handwritten digit recognition task. Convolutional neural networks, which are specifically designed to deal with the variability of 2D shapes, are shown to outperform all other techniques. Real-life document recognition systems are composed of multiple modules including field extraction, segmentation recognition, and language modeling. A new learning paradigm, called graph transformer networks (GTN), allows such multimodule systems to be trained globally using gradient-based methods so as to minimize an overall performance measure. Two systems for online handwriting recognition are described. Experiments demonstrate the advantage of global training, and the flexibility of graph transformer networks. A graph transformer network for reading a bank cheque is also described. It uses convolutional neural network character recognizers combined with global training techniques to provide record accuracy on business and personal cheques.

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.05746},
	abstract = {The Lennard-Jones 12-6 potential (LJ) is arguably the most widely used pair potential in Molecular Simulations. In fact, it is so popular that the question is rarely asked whether it is fit for purpose. In this paper, we argue that, whilst the LJ potential was designed for noble gases such as argon, it is often used for systems where it is not expected to be particularly realistic. Under those circumstances, the disadvantages of the LJ potential become relevant: most important among these is that in simulations the LJ potential is always modified such that it has a finite range. More seriously, there is by now a whole family of different potentials that are all called Lennard-Jones 12-6, and that are all different - and that may have very different macroscopic properties. In this paper, we consider alternatives to the LJ 12-6 potential that could be employed under conditions where the LJ potential is only used as a typical short-ranged potential with attraction. We construct a class of potentials that are, in many respects LJ-like but that are by construction finite ranged, vanishing quadratically at the cut-off distance, and that are designed to be computationally cheap. Below, we present this potential and report numerical data for its thermodynamic and transport properties, for the most important cases: cut-off distance rc=2 (LJ-like) and rc=1.2 (a typical colloidal potential).},

	abstract = {Neural networks have been very successful in many applications; we often, however, lack a theoretical understanding of what the neural networks are actually learning. This problem emerges when trying to generalise to new data sets. The contribution of this paper is to show that, for the residual neural network model, the deep layer limit coincides with a parameter estimation problem for a nonlinear ordinary differential equation. In particular, whilst it is known that the residual neural network model is a discretisation of an ordinary differential equation, we show convergence in a variational sense. This implies that optimal parameters converge in the deep layer limit. This is a stronger statement than saying for a ﬁxed parameter the residual neural network model converges (the latter does not in general imply the former). Our variational analysis provides a discrete-to-continuum Γ-convergence result for the objective function of the residual neural network training step to a variational problem constrained by a system of ordinary differential equations; this rigorously connects the discrete setting to a continuum problem.},

For measures on a d-dimensional manifold and under some non-degeneracy assumptions, this leads to a global optimization algorithm with a complexity scaling as log(1/ ) in the desired accuracy , instead of −d for convex methods. The key theoretical tools are a local convergence analysis in Wasserstein space and an analysis of a perturbed mirror descent in the space of measures. Our bounds involve quantities that are exponential in d which is unavoidable under our assumptions.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1903.01373},
	abstract = {We introduce α-Rank, a principled evolutionary dynamics methodology, for the evaluation and ranking of agents in large-scale multi-agent interactions, grounded in a novel dynamical game-theoretic solution concept called Markov-Conley chains (MCCs). The approach leverages continuous-time and discrete-time evolutionary dynamical systems applied to empirical games, and scales tractably in the number of agents, in the type of interactions (beyond dyadic), and the type of empirical games (symmetric and asymmetric). Current models are fundamentally limited in one or more of these dimensions, and are not guaranteed to converge to the desired game-theoretic solution concept (typically the Nash equilibrium). α-Rank automatically provides a ranking over the set of agents under evaluation and provides insights into their strengths, weaknesses, and long-term dynamics in terms of basins of attraction and sink components. This is a direct consequence of the correspondence we establish to the dynamical MCC solution concept when the underlying evolutionary model’s ranking-intensity parameter, α, is chosen to be large, which exactly forms the basis of α-Rank. In contrast to the Nash equilibrium, which is a static solution concept based solely on ﬁxed points, MCCs are a dynamical solution concept based on the Markov chain formalism, Conley’s Fundamental Theorem of Dynamical Systems, and the core ingredients of dynamical systems: ﬁxed points, recurrent sets, periodic orbits, and limit cycles. Our α-Rank method runs in polynomial time with respect to the total number of pure strategy proﬁles, whereas computing a Nash equilibrium for a general-sum game is known to be intractable. We introduce mathematical proofs that not only provide an overarching and unifying perspective of existing continuous- and discrete-time evolutionary evaluation models, but also reveal the formal underpinnings of the α-Rank methodology. We illustrate the method in canonical games and empirically validate it in several domains, including AlphaGo, AlphaZero, MuJoCo Soccer, and Poker.},

	abstract = {Recent single-molecule studies have been able to observe molecular transition paths, i.e., short and rare excursions where the molecule is caught in transit from one stable molecular conformation to another, motivating a flurry of theoretical work. Under equilibrium conditions, the temporal duration of a transition path, or the transition path time, exhibits a fundamental property that is a consequence of the time reversal symmetry: the distribution of the transition path time is independent of the transition direction (forward or backward). Many conformational changes occurring in living systems, however, take place away from equilibrium. Molecular motors, for example, make more steps in the forward than in the backward direction, resulting in overall unidirectional motion. Is the symmetry between the transition path times for individual steps in the forward and backward directions preserved in this case? Here, we show that this symmetry is still preserved if the transition occurs between (precisely) known microscopic states. However, since most experiments can only monitor some low-dimensional property of the system (e.g., the position of the molecular motor along its track), this symmetry, when applied to experimental observations, is generally broken, except in equilibrium. In a different language, the forward/backward symmetry violation occurs only if two conditions are met simultaneously: (1) the dynamics of the low-dimensional experimental observables is non-Markovian and (2) the system is not in equilibrium.},

By viewing deep neural networks as discrete-time nonlinear dynamical systems, we can analyze how information propagates through layers using mean ﬁeld theory. When optimization algorithms are further recast as controllers, the ultimate goal of training processes can be formulated as an optimal control problem. In addition, we can reveal convergence and generalization properties by studying the stochastic dynamics of optimization algorithms. This viewpoint features a wide range of theoretical study from information bottleneck to statistical physics. It also provides a principled way for hyper-parameter tuning when optimal control theory is introduced. Our framework ﬁts nicely with supervised learning and can be extended to other learning problems, such as Bayesian learning, adversarial training, and speciﬁc forms of meta learning, without efforts. The review aims to shed lights on the importance of dynamics and optimal control when developing deep learning theory.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a uniﬁed framework for smooth convex regularization of discrete optimal transport problems. In this context, the regularized optimal transport turns out to be equivalent to a matrix nearness problem with respect to Bregman divergences. Our framework thus naturally generalizes a previously proposed regularization based on the Boltzmann-Shannon entropy related to the Kullback-Leibler divergence, and solved with the Sinkhorn-Knopp algorithm. We call the regularized optimal transport distance the rot mover’s distance in reference to the classical earth mover’s distance. By exploiting alternate Bregman projections, we develop the alternate scaling algorithm and non-negative alternate scaling algorithm, to compute eﬃciently the regularized optimal plans depending on whether the domain of the regularizer lies within the non-negative orthant or not. We further enhance the separable case with a sparse extension to deal with high data dimensions. We also instantiate our framework and discuss the inherent speciﬁcities for well-known regularizers and statistical divergences in the machine learning and information geometry communities. Finally, we demonstrate the merits of our methods with experiments using synthetic data to illustrate the eﬀect of diﬀerent regularizers, penalties and dimensions, as well as real-world data for a pattern recognition application to audio scene classiﬁcation.},

	abstract = {This paper deﬁnes a new transport metric over the space of non-negative measures. This metric interpolates between the quadratic Wasserstein and the Fisher-Rao metrics and generalizes optimal transport to measures with diﬀerent masses. It is deﬁned as a generalization of the dynamical formulation of optimal transport of Benamou and Brenier, by introducing a source term in the continuity equation. The inﬂuence of this source term is measured using the Fisher-Rao metric, and is averaged with the transportation term. This gives rise to a convex variational problem deﬁning our metric. Our ﬁrst contribution is a proof of the existence of geodesics (i.e. solutions to this variational problem). We then show that (generalized) optimal transport and Fisher-Rao metrics are obtained as limiting cases of our metric. Our last theoretical contribution is a proof that geodesics between mixtures of suﬃciently close Diracs are made of translating mixtures of Diracs. Lastly, we propose a numerical scheme making use of ﬁrst order proximal splitting methods and we show an application of this new distance to image interpolation.},

	abstract = {Variational problems that involve Wasserstein distances and more generally optimal transport (OT) theory are playing an increasingly important role in data sciences. Such problems can be used to form an exemplar measure out of various probability measures, as in the Wasserstein barycenter problem, or to carry out parametric inference and density fitting, where the loss is measured in terms of an optimal transport cost to the measure of observations. Despite being conceptually simple, such problems are computationally challenging because they involve minimizing over quantities (Wasserstein distances) that are themselves hard to compute. Entropic regularization has recently emerged as an efficient tool to approximate the solution of such variational Wasserstein problems. In this paper, we give a thorough duality tour of these regularization techniques. In particular, we show how important concepts from classical OT such as c-transforms and semidiscrete approaches translate into similar ideas in a regularized setting. These dual formulations lead to smooth variational problems, which can be solved using smooth, differentiable, and convex optimization problems that are simpler to implement and numerically more stable than their unregularized counterparts. We illustrate the versatility of this approach by applying it to the computation of Wasserstein barycenters and gradient flows of spatial regularization functionals.},

          , 
            We propose a novel statistical learning framework for automatically and efficiently building reduced kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) models of large-scale elementary reaction networks from data generated by a single or few molecular dynamics simulations (MD). Existing approaches for identifying species and reactions from molecular dynamics typically use bond length and duration criteria, where bond duration is a fixed parameter motivated by an understanding of bond vibrational frequencies. In contrast, we show that for highly reactive systems, bond duration should be a model parameter that is chosen to maximize the predictive power of the resulting statistical model. We demonstrate our method on a high temperature, high pressure system of reacting liquid methane, and show that the learned KMC model is able to extrapolate more than an order of magnitude in time for key molecules. Additionally, our KMC model of elementary reactions enables us to isolate the most important set of reactions governing the behavior of key molecules found in the MD simulation. We develop a new data-driven algorithm to reduce the chemical reaction network which can be solved either as an integer program or efficiently using L1 regularization, and compare our results with simple count-based reduction. For our liquid methane system, we discover that rare reactions do not play a significant role in the system, and find that less than 7\% of the approximately 2000 reactions observed from molecular dynamics are necessary to reproduce the molecular concentration over time of methane. The framework described in this work paves the way towards a genomic approach to studying complex chemical systems, where expensive MD simulation data can be reused to contribute to an increasingly large and accurate genome of elementary reactions and rates.},

	abstract = {Most existing approaches to heterogeneous redundancy allocation problem (RAP) are prone to getting trapped in local optimal modes during optimization, mainly due to the rugged combinatoric landscapes. Recently, optimization-by-sampling paradigm based on the stochastic approximation Monte Carlo (SAMC) sampling has shown superior performance in solving the heterogeneous RAP for multistate systems (MSSs). However, one drawback of this method is that the global move of a Markov chain relying only on a uniform distribution is typically hard to hit the low-energy regions due to the uninformative proposal, leading to insufficient global exploration in sampling. To address the problem of where to sample for efficient optimization of heterogeneous RAP,we introduce a rejection-free Monte Carlo method to sample from the target distribution over the combinatorial space. Specifically, a model-based proposal learning algorithm is derived to guide the global exploration towards promising regions of the descrete state space. Experimental evaluations on a set of benchmark instances show the superiority of the proposed approach compared with the several state-of-the-arts in terms of the solution quality and computational efficiency.},

@article{gu_neural_nodate,
	title = {Neural {Adaptive} {Sequential} {Monte} {Carlo}},
	abstract = {Sequential Monte Carlo (SMC), or particle ﬁltering, is a popular class of methods for sampling from an intractable target distribution using a sequence of simpler intermediate distributions. Like other importance sampling-based methods, performance is critically dependent on the proposal distribution: a bad proposal can lead to arbitrarily inaccurate estimates of the target distribution. This paper presents a new method for automatically adapting the proposal using an approximation of the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the true posterior and the proposal distribution. The method is very ﬂexible, applicable to any parameterized proposal distribution and it supports online and batch variants. We use the new framework to adapt powerful proposal distributions with rich parameterizations based upon neural networks leading to Neural Adaptive Sequential Monte Carlo (NASMC). Experiments indicate that NASMC signiﬁcantly improves inference in a non-linear state space model outperforming adaptive proposal methods including the Extended Kalman and Unscented Particle Filters. Experiments also indicate that improved inference translates into improved parameter learning when NASMC is used as a subroutine of Particle Marginal Metropolis Hastings. Finally we show that NASMC is able to train a latent variable recurrent neural network (LV-RNN) achieving results that compete with the state-of-the-art for polymorphic music modelling. NASMC can be seen as bridging the gap between adaptive SMC methods and the recent work in scalable, black-box variational inference.},

	abstract = {Variational Auto-Encoders (VAEs) have become very popular techniques to perform inference and learning in latent variable models as they allow us to leverage the rich representational power of neural networks to obtain flexible approximations of the posterior of latent variables as well as tight evidence lower bounds (ELBOs). Combined with stochastic variational inference, this provides a methodology scaling to large datasets. However, for this methodology to be practically efficient, it is necessary to obtain low-variance unbiased estimators of the ELBO and its gradients with respect to the parameters of interest. While the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques such as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has been previously suggested to achieve this [23, 26], the proposed methods require specifying reverse kernels which have a large impact on performance. Additionally, the resulting unbiased estimator of the ELBO for most MCMC kernels is typically not amenable to the reparameterization trick. We show here how to optimally select reverse kernels in this setting and, by building upon Hamiltonian Importance Sampling (HIS) [17], we obtain a scheme that provides low-variance unbiased estimators of the ELBO and its gradients using the reparameterization trick. This allows us to develop a Hamiltonian Variational Auto-Encoder (HVAE). This method can be reinterpreted as a target-informed normalizing flow [20] which, within our context, only requires a few evaluations of the gradient of the sampled likelihood and trivial Jacobian calculations at each iteration.},

Their success dates back to Feynman who showed how to use them within the framework of quantum mechanics. Since then, path integrals have pervaded all areas of physics where ﬂuctuation eﬀects, quantum and/or thermal, are of paramount importance. Their appeal is based on the fact that one converts a problem formulated in terms of operators into one of sampling classical paths with a given weight. Path integrals are the mirror image of our conventional Riemann integrals, with functions replacing the real numbers one usually sums over. However, unlike conventional integrals, path integration suﬀers a serious drawback: in general, one cannot make non-linear changes of variables without committing an error of some sort. Thus, no path-integral based calculus is possible. Here we identify which are the deep mathematical reasons causing this important caveat, and we come up with cures for systems described by one degree of freedom. Our main result is a construction of path integration free of this longstanding problem, through a direct time-discretization procedure.},

	abstract = {Cellular functions are established through biological evolution, but are constrained by the laws of physics. For instance, the physics of protein folding limits the lengths of cellular polypeptide chains. Consequently, many cellular functions are carried out not by long, isolated proteins, but rather by multi-protein complexes. Protein complexes themselves do not escape physical constraints, one of the most important being the difficulty to assemble reliably in the presence of cellular noise. In order to lay the foundation for a theory of reliable protein complex assembly, we study here an equilibrium thermodynamic model of self-assembly that exhibits four distinct assembly behaviors: diluted protein solution, liquid mixture, "chimeric assembly" and "multifarious assembly". In the latter regime, different protein complexes can coexist without forming erroneous chimeric structures. We show that two conditions have to be fulfilled to attain this regime: (i) the composition of the complexes needs to be sufficiently heterogeneous, and (ii) the use of the set of components by the complexes has to be sparse. Our analysis of publicly available databases of protein complexes indicates that cellular protein systems might have indeed evolved so to satisfy both of these conditions.},

Employing a large deviation argument ﬁrst used for replica exchange molecular dynamics [Plattner et al. J. Chem. Phys. 135:134111 (2011)], we demonstrate that the most eﬃcient approach to simulated tempering is to vary the temperature inﬁnitely rapidly. In this limit, we can replace the equations of motion for the temperature and physical variables by averaged equations for the latter alone, with the forces rescaled according to a positiondependent function deﬁned in terms of temperature weights. The averaged equations are similar to those used in Gao’s integrated-over-temperature method, except that we show that it is better to use a continuous rather than a discrete set of temperatures. We give a theoretical argument for the choice of the temperature weights as the reciprocal partition function, thereby relating simulated tempering to Wang-Landau sampling. Finally, we describe a self-consistent algorithm for simultaneously sampling the canonical ensemble and learning the weights during simulation. This algorithm is tested on a system of harmonic oscillators as well as a continuous variant of the Curie-Weiss model, where it is shown to perform well and to accurately capture the second-order phase transition observed in this model.},

Trajectory stratification involves decomposing trajectories of the underlying process into fragments limited to restricted regions of state space (strata), computing averages over the distributions of the trajectory fragments within the strata with minimal communication between them, and combining those averages with appropriate weights to yield averages with respect to the original underlying process. Our framework reveals the full generality and flexibility of trajectory stratification, and it illuminates a common mathematical structure shared by existing algorithms for sampling rare events. We demonstrate the power of the framework by defining strata in terms of both points in time and path-dependent variables for efficiently estimating averages that were not previously tractable.},

	abstract = {We identify a fundamental source of error in Q-learning and other forms of dynamic programming with function approximation. Delusional bias arises when the approximation architecture limits the class of expressible greedy policies. Since standard Q-updates make globally uncoordinated action choices with respect to the expressible policy class, inconsistent or even conﬂicting Q-value estimates can result, leading to pathological behaviour such as over/under-estimation, instability and even divergence. To solve this problem, we introduce a new notion of policy consistency and deﬁne a local backup process that ensures global consistency through the use of information sets—sets that record constraints on policies consistent with backed-up Q-values. We prove that both the model-based and model-free algorithms using this backup remove delusional bias, yielding the ﬁrst known algorithms that guarantee optimal results under general conditions. These algorithms furthermore only require polynomially many information sets (from a potentially exponential support). Finally, we suggest other practical heuristics for value-iteration and Q-learning that attempt to reduce delusional bias.},

	abstract = {The Born−Oppenheimer approximation underlies much of chemical simulation and provides the framework deﬁning the potential energy surfaces that are used for much of our pictorial understanding of chemical phenomena. However, this approximation breaks down when the dynamics of molecules in excited electronic states are considered. Describing dynamics when the Born−Oppenheimer approximation breaks down requires a quantum mechanical description of the nuclei. Chemical reaction dynamics on excited electronic states is critical for many applications in renewable energy, chemical synthesis, and bioimaging. Furthermore, it is necessary in order to connect with many ultrafast pump−probe spectroscopic experiments. In this review, we provide an overview of methods that can describe nonadiabatic dynamics, with emphasis on those that are able to simultaneously address the quantum mechanics of both electrons and nuclei. Such ab initio quantum molecular dynamics methods solve the electronic Schrödinger equation alongside the nuclear dynamics and thereby avoid the need for precalculation of potential energy surfaces and nonadiabatic coupling matrix elements. Two main families of methods are commonly employed to simulate nonadiabatic dynamics in molecules: full quantum dynamics, such as the multiconﬁgurational time-dependent Hartree method, and classical trajectory-based approaches, such as trajectory surface hopping. In this review, we describe a third class of methods that is intermediate between the two: Gaussian basis set expansions built around trajectories.},

Lipid modiﬁcation is thought to facilitate the interaction of the protein with its receptor, Frizzled, but may also regulate the transport of Wnt protein and its localization at the cell membrane. Here, by employing single-molecule ﬂuorescence techniques, we show that Wnt proteins associate with and diffuse on the plasma membranes of living cells in the absence of any receptor binding. We ﬁnd that labeled Wnt3A transiently and dynamically associates with the membranes of Drosophila Schneider 2 cells, diffuses with Brownian kinetics on ﬂattened membranes and on cellular protrusions, and does not transfer between cells in close contact. In S2 receptor-plus (S2Rþ) cells, which express Frizzled receptors, membrane diffusion rate is reduced and membrane residency time is increased. These results provide direct evidence of Wnt3A interaction with living cell membranes, and represent, to our knowledge, a new system for investigating the dynamics of Wnt transport.},

We show how for this problem, the dynamics of SGD are captured by a set of differential equations. In particular, we demonstrate analytically that the generalisation error of the student increases linearly with the network size, with other relevant parameters held constant.

	abstract = {Given sparse or low-quality radial-velocity measurements of a star, there are often many qualitatively different stellar or exoplanet companion orbit models that are consistent with the data. The consequent multimodality of the likelihood function leads to extremely challenging search, optimization, and MCMC posterior sampling over the orbital parameters. Here we create a custom Monte Carlo sampler for sparse or noisy radial-velocity measurements of two-body systems that can produce posterior samples for orbital parameters even when the likelihood function is poorly behaved. The six standard orbital parameters for a binary system can be split into four non-linear parameters (period, eccentricity, argument of pericenter, phase) and two linear parameters (velocity amplitude, barycenter velocity). We capitalize on this by building a sampling method in which we densely sample the prior pdf in the non-linear parameters and perform rejection sampling using a likelihood function marginalized over the linear parameters. With sparse or uninformative data, the sampling obtained by this rejection sampling is generally multimodal and dense. With informative data, the sampling becomes effectively unimodal but too sparse: in these cases we follow the rejection sampling with standard MCMC. The method produces correct samplings in orbital parameters for data that include as few as three epochs. The Joker can therefore be used to produce proper samplings of multimodal pdfs, which are still informative and can be used in hierarchical (population) modeling. We give some examples that show how the posterior pdf depends sensitively on the number and time coverage of the observations and their uncertainties.},

Furthermore, mirroring the correspondence between wide Bayesian neural networks and Gaussian processes, gradient-based training of wide neural networks with a squared loss produces test set predictions drawn from a Gaussian process with a particular compositional kernel. While these theoretical results are only exact in the inﬁnite width limit, we nevertheless ﬁnd excellent empirical agreement between the predictions of the original network and those of the linearized version even for ﬁnite practically-sized networks. This agreement is robust across different architectures, optimization methods, and loss functions.},

	abstract = {Optimal a priori estimates are derived for the population risk of a regularized residual network model. The key lies in the designing of a new path norm, called the weighted path norm, which serves as the regularization term in the regularized model. The weighted path norm treats the skip connections and the nonlinearities diﬀerently so that paths with more nonlinearities have larger weights. The error estimates are a priori in nature in the sense that the estimates depend only on the target function and not on the parameters obtained in the training process. The estimates are optimal in the sense that the bound scales as O(1/L) with the network depth and the estimation error is comparable to the Monte Carlo error rates. In particular, optimal error bounds are obtained, for the ﬁrst time, in terms of the depth of the network model. Comparisons are made with existing norm-based generalization error bounds.},

It is proved that in the over-parametrized regime, for a suitable initialization, with high probability GD can ﬁnd a global minimum exponentially fast. Generalization error estimates along the GD path are also established. As a consequence, it is shown that when the target function is in the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) with a kernel deﬁned by the initialization, there exist generalizable earlystopping solutions along the GD path. In addition, it is also shown that the GD path is uniformly close to the functions given by the related random feature model. Consequently, in this “implicit regularization” setting, the deep neural network model deteriorates to a random feature model. Our results hold for neural networks of any width larger than the input dimension.},

	abstract = {Deep learning has arguably achieved tremendous success in recent years. In simple words, deep learning uses the composition of many nonlinear functions to model the complex dependency between input features and labels. While neural networks have a long history, recent advances have greatly improved their performance in computer vision, natural language processing, etc. From the statistical and scientiﬁc perspective, it is natural to ask: What is deep learning? What are the new characteristics of deep learning, compared with classical methods? What are the theoretical foundations of deep learning? To answer these questions, we introduce common neural network models (e.g., convolutional neural nets, recurrent neural nets, generative adversarial nets) and training techniques (e.g., stochastic gradient descent, dropout, batch normalization) from a statistical point of view. Along the way, we highlight new characteristics of deep learning (including depth and over-parametrization) and explain their practical and theoretical beneﬁts. We also sample recent results on theories of deep learning, many of which are only suggestive. While a complete understanding of deep learning remains elusive, we hope that our perspectives and discussions serve as a stimulus for new statistical research.},

ICLR'17]. (ii) Generalization bound independent of network size, using a data-dependent complexity measure. Our measure distinguishes clearly between random labels and true labels on MNIST and CIFAR, as shown by experiments. Moreover, recent papers require sample complexity to increase (slowly) with the size, while our sample complexity is completely independent of the network size.

	abstract = {Recent work linking deep neural networks and dynamical systems opened up new avenues to analyze deep learning. In particular, it is observed that new insights can be obtained by recasting deep learning as an optimal control problem on diﬀerence or diﬀerential equations. However, the mathematical aspects of such a formulation have not been systematically explored. This paper introduces the mathematical formulation of the population risk minimization problem in deep learning as a mean-ﬁeld optimal control problem. Mirroring the development of classical optimal control, we state and prove optimality conditions of both the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman type and the Pontryagin type. These mean-ﬁeld results reﬂect the probabilistic nature of the learning problem. In addition, by appealing to the mean-ﬁeld Pontryagin’s maximum principle, we establish some quantitative relationships between population and empirical learning problems. This serves to establish a mathematical foundation for investigating the algorithmic and theoretical connections between optimal control and deep learning.},

	abstract = {Interpolators—estimators that achieve zero training error—have attracted growing attention in machine learning, mainly because state-of-the art neural networks appear to be models of this type. In this paper, we study minimum 2 norm (“ridgeless”) interpolation in high-dimensional least squares regression. We consider two different models for the feature distribution: a linear model, where the feature vectors xi ∈ Rp are obtained by applying a linear transform to a vector of i.i.d. entries, xi = Σ1/2zi (with zi ∈ Rp); and a nonlinear model, where the feature vectors are obtained by passing the input through a random one-layer neural network, xi = ϕ(W zi) (with zi ∈ Rd, W ∈ Rp×d a matrix of i.i.d. entries, and ϕ an activation function acting componentwise on W zi). We recover—in a precise quantitative way—several phenomena that have been observed in large-scale neural networks and kernel machines, including the “double descent” behavior of the prediction risk, and the potential beneﬁts of overparametrization.},

This is the space of functions that the particular machine learning model can approximate with good accuracy, endowed with a natural norm associated with the approximation process. In this paper, we address this issue for two representative neural network models: the two-layer networks and the residual neural networks. We deﬁne Barron space and show that it is the right space for two-layer neural network models in the sense that optimal direct and inverse approximation theorems hold for functions in the Barron space. For residual neural network models, we construct the so-called compositional function space, and prove direct and inverse approximation theorems for this space. In addition, we show that the Rademacher complexity has the optimal upper bounds for these spaces.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) sampling methods provide a mechanism for defining distant proposals with high acceptance probabilities in a Metropolis-Hastings framework, enabling more efficient exploration of the state space than standard random-walk proposals. The popularity of such methods has grown significantly in recent years. However, a limitation of HMC methods is the required gradient computation for simulation of the Hamiltonian dynamical system-such computation is infeasible in problems involving a large sample size or streaming data. Instead, we must rely on a noisy gradient estimate computed from a subset of the data. In this paper, we explore the properties of such a stochastic gradient HMC approach. Surprisingly, the natural implementation of the stochastic approximation can be arbitrarily bad. To address this problem we introduce a variant that uses second-order Langevin dynamics with a friction term that counteracts the effects of the noisy gradient, maintaining the desired target distribution as the invariant distribution. Results on simulated data validate our theory. We also provide an application of our methods to a classification task using neural networks and to online Bayesian matrix factorization.},

We prove rigorously that the diffusion process can approximate the SGD algorithm weakly using the weak form of master equation for probability evolution. In the small step size regime and the presence of omnidirectional noise, our weak approximating diffusion process suggests the following dynamics for the SGD iteration starting from a local minimizer (resp.{\textbackslash}textasciitildesaddle point): it escapes in a number of iterations exponentially (resp.{\textbackslash}textasciitildealmost linearly) dependent on the inverse stepsize. The results are obtained using the theory for random perturbations of dynamical systems (theory of large deviations for local minimizers and theory of exiting for unstable stationary points). In addition, we discuss the effects of batch size for the deep neural networks, and we find that small batch size is helpful for SGD algorithms to escape unstable stationary points and sharp minimizers. Our theory indicates that one should increase the batch size at later stage for the SGD to be trapped in flat minimizers for better generalization.},

These methods operate in a small-batch regime wherein a fraction of the training data, say 32-512 data points, is sampled to compute an approximation to the gradient. It has been observed in practice that when using a larger batch there is a degradation in the quality of the model, as measured by its ability to generalize. We investigate the cause for this generalization drop in the large-batch regime and present numerical evidence that supports the view that large-batch methods tend to converge to sharp minimizers of the training and testing functions - and as is well known, sharp minima lead to poorer generalization. In contrast, small-batch methods consistently converge to flat minimizers, and our experiments support a commonly held view that this is due to the inherent noise in the gradient estimation. We discuss several strategies to attempt to help large-batch methods eliminate this generalization gap.},

	abstract = {A microscopic theory is developed which can describe many of the structural and thermodynamic properties of infinitely dilute solutions of apolar solutes in liquid water. The theory is based on an integral equation for the pair correlation functions associated with spherical apolar species dissolved in water. It requires as input the experimentally determined oxygen–oxygen correlation function for pure liquid water. The theory is tested by computing thermodynamic properties for aqueous solutions of apolar solute species. The predictions of both the Henry’s Law constant and the entropy of solution are in good agreement with experiment. The calculation of the latter quantity is essentially independent of any adjustable parameters. It is shown how the correlation functions we have calculated can be used to predict the solubility of more complicated, aspherical, and nonrigid solutes in liquid water. For the more complex molecules it is convenient to study the difference between the excess chemical potential of the molecule and the chemical potentials of its separated components (Ben-Naim’s measure of the hydrophobic interaction strength δA (HI) M ). A generalized formula for δA (HI) M is presented which reduces to Ben-Naim’s result in the special case of a rigid solute. The calculations of δA (HI) M for normal alkanes through n-decane are independent of unknown and adjustable mean field parameters. For ethane, the theoretical results for δA (HI) M are in good agreement with experimental data. To treat longer alkanes multipoint correlation functions are required. It is shown that the standard superposition approximation for the multipoint correlation functions predicts qualitatively incorrect results. A correction to the superposition approximation is developed. Its use yields theoretical values for δA (HI) M which agree well with experiment. We also calculate free energies of transfer of n-alkane solutes from a hydrocarbon solvent to liquid water. Here, too, our results are in good agreement with experiment. After testing the theory against experiment, several experimentally inaccessible aspects of the hydrophobic effect are discussed. Analysis of pair correlation functions between spherical apolar species indicates that the hydrophobic interaction becomes more attractive as the solute size is increased at constant temperature, or as the temperature is d e c r e a s e d. The solute–solute correlations in liquid water are compared with those in a nonassociated (hard-spherelike) solvent. Plots are presented which indicate that the insertion of an apolar species increases the intermolecular structure of water in the vicinity of the apolar solute. The effects of solvent environments on the conformations of small chain molecules are discussed. It is shown that hydrocarbon solvents as well as water tend to reduce the spatial extension of the chain molecules from what is found in the gas phase. However, calculations which take cognizance of the detailed structure of the solvent liquids reveal that the average conformational structure of some n-alkanes may be more compact in some nonassociated solvents than in water.},

Because systems with many components are inherently complicated, one might assume that the chances of successful self-assembly are extraordinarily small. Yet recent advances suggest otherwise: addressable structures with hundreds of distinct building blocks have been designed and assembled with nanometer precision. Despite this remarkable success, it is often challenging to optimize a self-assembly reaction to ensure that the intended structure is kinetically accessible. In this Perspective, we focus on the prediction of kinetic pathways for self-assembly and implications for the design of robust experimental protocols. The development of general principles to predict these pathways will enable the engineering of complex materials using a much wider range of building blocks than is currently possible.},

In many of these applications equipping the resulting classification with a measure of uncertainty may be as important as the classification itself. In this paper we introduce, develop algorithms for, and investigate the properties of, a variety of Bayesian models for the task of binary classification; via the posterior distribution on the classification labels, these methods automatically give measures of uncertainty. The methods are all based around the graph formulation of semi-supervised learning. We provide a unified framework which brings together a variety of methods which have been introduced in different communities within the mathematical sciences. We study probit classification, generalize the level-set method for Bayesian inverse problems to the classification setting, and generalize the Ginzburg-Landau optimization-based classifier to a Bayesian setting; we also show that the probit and level set approaches are natural relaxations of the harmonic function approach. We introduce efficient numerical methods, suited to large data-sets, for both MCMC-based sampling as well as gradient-based MAP estimation. Through numerical experiments we study classification accuracy and uncertainty quantification for our models; these experiments showcase a suite of datasets commonly used to evaluate graph-based semi-supervised learning algorithms.},

	abstract = {The loss surface of deep neural networks has recently attracted interest in the optimization and machine learning communities as a prime example of high-dimensional non-convex problem. Some insights were recently gained using spin glass models and mean-field approximations, but at the expense of strongly simplifying the nonlinear nature of the model. In this work, we do not make any such assumption and study conditions on the data distribution and model architecture that prevent the existence of bad local minima. Our theoretical work quantifies and formalizes two important folklore facts: (i) the landscape of deep linear networks has a radically different topology from that of deep half-rectified ones, and (ii) that the energy landscape in the non-linear case is fundamentally controlled by the interplay between the smoothness of the data distribution and model over-parametrization. Our main theoretical contribution is to prove that half-rectified single layer networks are asymptotically connected, and we provide explicit bounds that reveal the aforementioned interplay. The conditioning of gradient descent is the next challenge we address. We study this question through the geometry of the level sets, and we introduce an algorithm to efficiently estimate the regularity of such sets on large-scale networks. Our empirical results show that these level sets remain connected throughout all the learning phase, suggesting a near convex behavior, but they become exponentially more curvy as the energy level decays, in accordance to what is observed in practice with very low curvature attractors.},

Such a process occurs during the formation of the carboxysome, a bacterial microcompartment that assembles around many copies of the enzymes ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/ oxygenase and carbonic anhydrase to facilitate carbon fixation in cyanobacteria. Our simulations identify two classes of assembly pathways leading to encapsulation of many-molecule cargoes. In one, shell assembly proceeds concomitantly with cargo condensation. In the other, the cargo first forms a dense globule; then, shell proteins assemble around and bud from the condensed cargo complex. Although the model is simplified, the simulations predict intermediates and closure mechanisms not accessible in experiments, and show how assembly can be tuned between these two pathways by modulating protein interactions. In addition to elucidating assembly pathways and critical control parameters for microcompartment assembly, our results may guide the reengineering of viruses as nanoreactors that self-assemble around their reactants.},

This leads to significant complexities in the energy reformulations and resultant dynamics, often leading to implicit systems of equations and requiring inversion of high-dimensional matrices in the leapfrog steps. Our approach provides a simpler alternative, by using existing dynamics in the sampling step of a Monte Carlo EM framework, and learning the mass matrices in the M step with a novel online technique. We also propose a way to adaptively set the number of samples gathered in the E step, using sampling error estimates from the leapfrog dynamics. Along with a novel stochastic sampler based on Nosé-Poincaré dynamics, we use this framework with standard Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) as well as newer stochastic algorithms such as SGHMC and SGNHT, and show strong performance on synthetic and real high-dimensional sampling scenarios; we achieve sampling accuracies comparable to Riemannian samplers while being significantly faster.},

In the limit of a short system-unit interaction time, we further demonstrate that this setup can be used to provide a thermodynamically sound interpretation to many effective master equations. We discuss how non-autonomously driven systems, micromasers, lasing without inversion, and the electronic Maxwell demon, can be thermodynamically analyzed within our framework.

This has turned into a bottleneck as new hardware generations primarily provide more processing units rather than making individual units much faster, which simulation applications are addressing by increasingly focusing on sampling with algorithms such as free-energy perturbation, Markov state modeling, metadynamics, or milestoning. All these rely on combining results from multiple simulations into a single observation. They are potentially powerful approaches that aim to predict experimental observables directly, but this comes at the expense of added complexity in selecting sampling strategies and keeping track of dozens to thousands of simulations and their dependencies. Here, we describe how the distributed execution framework Copernicus allows the expression of such algorithms in generic workflows: dataflow programs. Because dataflow algorithms explicitly state dependencies of each constituent part, algorithms only need to be described on conceptual level, after which the execution is maximally parallel. The fully automated execution facilitates the optimization of these algorithms with adaptive sampling, where undersampled regions are automatically detected and targeted without user intervention. We show how several such algorithms can be formulated for computational chemistry problems, and how they are executed efficiently with many loosely coupled simulations using either distributed or parallel resources with Copernicus.},

Using Monte Carlo simulations we study how the process depends on particle size and binding strength, and present accurate free energy calculations to sort out how tube formation compares with the competing budding process. We find that tube formation is a result of the collective behavior of the particles adhering on the surface, and it occurs for binding strengths that are smaller than those required for budding. We also find that long linear aggregates of particles forming on the membrane surface act as nucleation seeds for tubulation by lowering the free energy barrier associated to the process.},

	abstract = {Well-tempered metadynamics has proven to be a practical and efficient adaptive enhanced sampling method for the computational study of biomolecular and materials systems. However, choosing its tunable parameter can be challenging and requires balancing a trade-off between fast escape from local metastable states and fast convergence of an overall free energy estimate. In this article, we present a new smoothly convergent variant of metadynamics, transition-tempered metadynamics, that removes that trade-off and is more robust to changes in its own single tunable parameter, resulting in substantial speed and accuracy improvements. The new method is specifically designed to study state-to-state transitions in which the states of greatest interest are known ahead of time, but transition mechanisms are not. The design is guided by a picture of adaptive enhanced sampling as a means to increase dynamical connectivity of a model's state space until percolation between all points of interest is reached, and it uses the degree of dynamical percolation to automatically tune the convergence rate. We apply the new method to Brownian dynamics on 48 random 1D surfaces, blocked alanine dipeptide in vacuo, and aqueous myoglobin, finding that transition-tempered metadynamics substantially and reproducibly improves upon well-tempered metadynamics in terms of first barrier crossing rate, convergence rate, and robustness to the choice of tuning parameter. Moreover, the trade-off between first barrier crossing rate and convergence rate is eliminated: the new method drives escape from an initial metastable state as fast as metadynamics without tempering, regardless of tuning.},

By viewing a Langevin process on a compact oriented manifold of arbitrary dimension m as a theory of a random vector field associated with the environment, we are able to consider stochastic motion of higher-dimensional objects, which allow new observables, called higher-dimensional currents, to be introduced. These higher dimensional currents arise by counting intersections of a k-dimensional trajectory, produced by a evolving (k-1)-dimensional cycle, with a reference cross section, represented by a cycle of complimentary dimension (m - k). We further express the mean fluxes in terms of the solutions of the Supersymmetric Fokker-Planck (SFP), thus generalizing the corresponding well-known expressions for the conventional currents.},

	abstract = {We report the results of a large scale computer simulation of a binary supercooled Lennard-Jones liquid. We find that at low temperatures the curves for the mean squared displacement of a tagged particle for different temperatures fall onto a master curve when they are plotted versus rescaled time tD(T), where D(T) is the diffusion constant. The time range for which these curves follow the master curve is identified with the {\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textbackslash}alpha-relaxation regime of mode-coupling theory (MCT). This master curve is fitted well by a functional form suggested by MCT. In accordance with idealized MCT, D(T) shows a power-law behavior at low temperatures. The critical temperature of this power law is the same for both types of particles, and also the critical exponents are very similar. However, contrary to a prediction of MCT, these exponents are not equal to the ones determined previously for the divergence of the relaxation times of the intermediate scattering function [Phys. Rev. Lett. 73, 1376 (1994)]. At low temperatures, the van Hove correlation function (self as well as distinct part) shows almost no sign of relaxation in a time interval that extends over about three decades in time. This time interval can be interpreted as the {\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textbackslash}beta-relaxation regime of MCT. From the investigation of these correlation functions, we conclude the hopping processes are not important on the time scale of the {\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textbackslash}beta relaxation for this system and for the temperature range investigated. We test whether the factorization property predicted by MCT holds and find that this is indeed the case for all correlation functions investigated. The distance dependences of the critical amplitudes are in qualitative agreement with the ones predicted by MCT for some other mixtures. The non-Gaussian parameter for the self part of the van Hove correlation function for different temperatures follows a master curve when plotted against time t.},

Through case studies on text classification and the training of deep neural networks, we discuss how optimization problems arise in machine learning and what makes them challenging. A major theme of our study is that large-scale machine learning represents a distinctive setting in which the stochastic gradient (SG) method has traditionally played a central role while conventional gradient-based nonlinear optimization techniques typically falter. Based on this viewpoint, we present a comprehensive theory of a straightforward, yet versatile SG algorithm, discuss its practical behavior, and highlight opportunities for designing algorithms with improved performance. This leads to a discussion about the next generation of optimization methods for large-scale machine learning, including an investigation of two main streams of research on techniques that diminish noise in the stochastic directions and methods that make use of second-order derivative approximations.},

	abstract = {α-Proteobacteria uniquely integrate features of two-component signal transduction (TCS) and alternative sigma factor (σ) regulation to control transcription in response to general stress. The core of this regulatory system is the PhyR protein, which contains a σ-like (SL) domain and a TCS receiver domain. Aspartyl phosphorylation of the PhyR receiver in response to stress signals promotes binding of the anti-σ factor, NepR, to PhyR-SL. This mechanism, whereby NepR switches binding between its cognate σ factor and phospho-PhyR (PhyR∼P), controls transcription of the general stress regulon. We have defined the structural basis of the PhyR∼P/NepR interaction in Caulobacter crescentus and characterized the effect of aspartyl phosphorylation on PhyR structure by molecular dynamics simulations. Our data support a model in which phosphorylation of the PhyR receiver domain promotes its dissociation from the PhyR-SL domain, which exposes the NepR binding site. A highly dynamic loop-helix region (α3-α4) of the PhyR-SL domain plays an important role in PhyR∼P binding to NepR in vitro, and in stress-dependent activation of transcription in vivo. This study provides a foundation for understanding the protein-protein interactions and protein structural dynamics that underpin general stress adaptation in a large and metabolically diverse clade of the bacterial kingdom.},

	abstract = {In this paper we study the problem of learning a shallow artificial neural network that best fits a training data set. We study this problem in the over-parameterized regime where the number of observations are fewer than the number of parameters in the model. We show that with quadratic activations the optimization landscape of training such shallow neural networks has certain favorable characteristics that allow globally optimal models to be found efficiently using a variety of local search heuristics. This result holds for an arbitrary training data of input/output pairs. For differentiable activation functions we also show that gradient descent, when suitably initialized, converges at a linear rate to a globally optimal model. This result focuses on a realizable model where the inputs are chosen i.i.d. from a Gaussian distribution and the labels are generated according to planted weight coefficients.},

While this elegant mathematical framework has inspired numerous studies of exactly solvable systems, no description of the thermodynamic geometry yet exists when the metric cannot be derived analytically.

Low-energy structures and connectivities are explored using a Monte Carlo simulated annealing method while also constraining the internal volume of the membrane to simulate incompressible contents within the membrane, such as in colloidosomes and viruses. We find that since the volume constraint partially suppresses the buckling transition such that the buckled icosahedral shape has a reduced asphericity, defect scars are favorable over a larger range of elastic parameters of the membrane compared with systems having no constraint on volume.},

The deﬁnition that has been given for this partition function within the framework of discrete time Markov chains was not suitable for continuous time Markov dynamics. Here we propose another interpretation of the deﬁnition that allows us to apply the thermodynamic formalism to continuous time. We also generalize the formalism—a dynamical Gibbs ensemble construction—to a whole family of observables and their associated large deviation functions. This allows us to make the connection between the thermodynamic formalism and the observable involved in the much-studied ﬂuctuation theorem. We illustrate our approach on various physical systems: random walks, exclusion processes, an Ising model and the contact process. In the latter cases, we identify a signature of the occurrence of dynamical phase transitions. We show that this signature can already be unraveled using the simplest dynamical ensemble one could deﬁne, based on the number of conﬁguration changes a system has undergone over an asymptotically large time window.},

	abstract = {Entropy production plays a fundamental role in nonequilibrium thermodynamics to quantify the irreversibility of open systems. Its positivity can be ensured for a wide class of setups, but the entropy production rate can become negative sometimes. This is often taken as an indicator of non-Markovian dynamics. We make this link precise by showing under which conditions a negative entropy production rate implies non-Markovian dynamics and when it does not. This is established within a unified language for two setups: (i) the dynamics resulting from a coarse-grained description of a system in contact with a single heat bath described by a Markovian master equation and (ii) the classical Hamiltonian dynamics of a driven system, which is coupled arbitrary strongly to a single heat bath. The quantum version of the latter result is shown not to hold despite the fact that the integrated thermodynamic description is formally equivalent to the classical case. The instantaneous steady state of a non-Markovian dynamics plays an important element in our study. Our key contribution is to provide a consistent theoretical framework to study the finite-time thermodynamics of a large class of dynamics with a precise link to its non-Markovianity.},

This problem is especially important in Bayesian statistics, which frames all inference about unknown quantities as a calculation involving the posterior density. In this paper, we review variational inference (VI), a method from machine learning that approximates probability densities through optimization. VI has been used in many applications and tends to be faster than classical methods, such as Markov chain Monte Carlo sampling. The idea behind VI is to ﬁrst posit a family of densities and then to ﬁnd the member of that family which is close to the target. Closeness is measured by Kullback-Leibler divergence. We review the ideas behind mean-ﬁeld variational inference, discuss the special case of VI applied to exponential family models, present a full example with a Bayesian mixture of Gaussians, and derive a variant that uses stochastic optimization to scale up to massive data. We discuss modern research in VI and highlight important open problems. VI is powerful, but it is not yet well understood. Our hope in writing this paper is to catalyze statistical research on this class of algorithms.},

	abstract = {Recent developments in synthetic molecular motors and pumps have sprung from a remarkable confluence of experiment and theory. Synthetic accomplishments have facilitated the ability to design and create molecules, many of them featuring mechanically bonded components, to carry out specific functions in their environment—walking along a polymeric track, unidirectional circling of one ring about another, synthesizing stereoisomers according to an external protocol, or pumping rings onto a long rod-like molecule to form and maintain high-energy, complex, nonequilibrium structures from simpler antecedents. Progress in the theory of nanoscale stochastic thermodynamics, specifically the generalization and extension of the principle of microscopic reversibility to the single-molecule regime, has enhanced the understanding of the design requirements for achieving strong unidirectional motion and high efficiency of these synthetic molecular machines for harnessing energy from external fluctuations to carry out mechanical and/or chemical functions in their environment. A key insight is that the interaction between the fluctuations and the transition state energies plays a central role in determining the steady-state concentrations. Kinetic asymmetry, a requirement for stochastic adaptation, occurs when there is an imbalance in the effect of the fluctuations on the forward and reverse rate constants. Because of strong viscosity, the motions of the machine can be viewed as mechanical equilibrium processes where mechanical resonances are simply impossible but where the probability distributions for the state occupancies and trajectories are very different from those that would be expected at thermodynamic equilibrium.},

Among the latter, the best statistical guarantees have been proved, for third-order tensors, using the sixth level of the sum-ofsquares (SOS) semideﬁnite programming hierarchy. However, the SOS approach does not scale well to large problem instances. By contrast, spectral methods—based on unfolding or matricizing the tensor—are attractive for their low complexity, but have been believed to require a much larger sample size.},

Unfortunately, generic SDP solvers hardly scale beyond instances with a few hundreds variables (in the underlying combinatorial problem). On the other hand, it has been observed empirically that an eﬀective strategy amounts to introducing a (non-convex) rank constraint, and solving the resulting smooth optimization problem by ascent methods. This non-convex problem has –generically– a large number of local maxima, and the reason for this success is therefore unclear. This paper provides rigorous support for this approach. For the problem of maximizing a linear functional over the elliptope, we prove that all local maxima are within a small gap from the SDP optimum. In several problems of interest, arbitrarily small relative error can be achieved by taking the rank constraint k to be of order one, independently of the problem size.},

	abstract = {Simulated annealing—moving from a tractable distribution to a distribution of interest via a sequence of intermediate distributions—has traditionally been used as an inexact method of handling isolated modes in Markov chain samplers. Here, it is shown how one can use the Markov chain transitions for such an annealing sequence to deﬁne an importance sampler. The Markov chain aspect allows this method to perform acceptably even for high-dimensional problems, where ﬁnding good importance sampling distributions would otherwise be very difﬁcult, while the use of importance weights ensures that the estimates found converge to the correct values as the number of annealing runs increases. This annealed importance sampling procedure resembles the second half of the previously-studied tempered transitions, and can be seen as a generalization of a recently-proposed variant of sequential importance sampling. It is also related to thermodynamic integration methods for estimating ratios of normalizing constants. Annealed importance sampling is most attractive when isolated modes are present, or when estimates of normalizing constants are required, but it may also be more generally useful, since its independent sampling allows one to bypass some of the problems of assessing convergence and autocorrelation in Markov chain samplers.},

While NS technically requires independent generation of particles, Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) exploration ﬁts naturally into this technique.

	abstract = {Bayesian inference involves two main computational challenges. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the posterior distribution may well be highly multimodal: a regime in which the convergence to stationarity of traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) techniques becomes incredibly slow. Second, in selecting between a set of competing models the necessary estimation of the Bayesian evidence for each is, by deﬁnition, a (possibly high-dimensional) integration over the entire parameter space; again this can be a daunting computational task, although new Monte Carlo (MC) integration algorithms offer solutions of ever increasing efﬁciency. Nested sampling (NS) is one such contemporary MC strategy targeted at calculation of the Bayesian evidence, but which also enables posterior inference as a by-product, thereby allowing simultaneous parameter estimation and model selection. The widely-used MULTINEST algorithm presents a particularly efﬁcient implementation of the NS technique for multi-modal posteriors. In this paper we discuss importance nested sampling (INS), an alternative summation of the MULTINEST draws, which can calculate the Bayesian evidence at up to an order of magnitude higher accuracy than ‘vanilla’ NS with no change in the way MULTINEST explores the parameter space. This is accomplished by treating as a (pseudo-)importance sample the totality of points collected by MULTINEST, including those previously discarded under the constrained likelihood sampling of the NS algorithm. We apply this technique to several challenging test problems and compare the accuracy of Bayesian evidences obtained with INS against those from vanilla NS.},

	abstract = {In performing a Bayesian analysis of astronomical data, two difﬁcult problems often emerge. First, in estimating the parameters of some model for the data, the resulting posterior distribution may be multimodal or exhibit pronounced (curving) degeneracies, which can cause problems for traditional Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods. Secondly, in selecting between a set of competing models, calculation of the Bayesian evidence for each model is computationally expensive using existing methods such as thermodynamic integration. The nested sampling method introduced by Skilling, has greatly reduced the computational expense of calculating evidence and also produces posterior inferences as a by-product. This method has been applied successfully in cosmological applications by Mukherjee, Parkinson \& Liddle, but their implementation was efﬁcient only for unimodal distributions without pronounced degeneracies. Shaw, Bridges \& Hobson recently introduced a clustered nested sampling method which is signiﬁcantly more efﬁcient in sampling from multimodal posteriors and also determines the expectation and variance of the ﬁnal evidence from a single run of the algorithm, hence providing a further increase in efﬁciency. In this paper, we build on the work of Shaw et al. and present three new methods for sampling and evidence evaluation from distributions that may contain multiple modes and signiﬁcant degeneracies in very high dimensions; we also present an even more efﬁcient technique for estimating the uncertainty on the evaluated evidence. These methods lead to a further substantial improvement in sampling efﬁciency and robustness, and are applied to two toy problems to demonstrate the accuracy and economy of the evidence calculation and parameter estimation. Finally, we discuss the use of these methods in performing Bayesian object detection in astronomical data sets, and show that they signiﬁcantly outperform existing MCMC techniques. An implementation of our methods will be publicly released shortly.},

Given a regression or classiﬁcation problem in which we wish to predict a response variable Y from an explanatory variable X, we treat the problem of dimensionality reduction as that of ﬁnding a low-dimensional “eﬀective subspace” for X which retains the statistical relationship between X and Y . We show that this problem can be formulated in terms of conditional independence. To turn this formulation into an optimization problem we establish a general nonparametric characterization of conditional independence using covariance operators on reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces. This characterization allows us to derive a contrast function for estimation of the eﬀective subspace. Unlike many conventional methods for dimensionality reduction in supervised learning, the proposed method requires neither assumptions on the marginal distribution of X, nor a parametric model of the conditional distribution of Y . We present experiments that compare the performance of the method with conventional methods.},

Dissection of the thermodynamic landscape governing protein–ligand interactions has proven difﬁcult because determination of various entropic contributions is quite challenging. Nuclear magnetic resonance relaxation measurements, theory, and simulations suggest that conformational entropy can be accessed through a dynamical proxy. Here, we review the relationship between measures of fast side-chain motion and the underlying conformational entropy. The dynamical proxy reveals that the contribution of conformational entropy can range from highly favorable to highly unfavorable and demonstrates the potential of this key thermodynamic variable to modulate protein–ligand interactions. The dynamical so-called entropy meter also reﬁnes the role of solvent entropy and directly determines the loss in rotational–translational entropy that occurs upon formation of high-afﬁnity complexes. The ability to quantify the roles of entropy through an entropy meter based on measurable dynamical properties promises to highlight its role in protein function.},

In this work, we prove that if the model predictions on the training set approach the true conditional distribution of labels given inputs, then the noise inherent in minibatch gradients causes the stationary distribution of NGD to approach a Bayesian posterior, whose temperature T ≈ N/(2B) is controlled by the learning rate , training set size N and batch size B. The parameter-dependence of the Fisher metric introduces an implicit prior over the parameters, which we identify as the well-known Jeffreys prior. To support our claims, we show that the distribution of samples from NGD is close to the Laplace approximation to the posterior when T = 1. Furthermore, the test loss of ensembles drawn using NGD falls rapidly as we increase the batch size until B ≈ N/2, while above this point the test loss is constant or rises slowly.},

Either simple local algorithms succeed in estimating the object of interest, or even sophisticated semi-deﬁnite programming (SDP) relaxations fail. In order to explore this phenomenon, we study a classical SDP relaxation of the minimum graph bisection problem, when applied to Erdo˝s-R´enyi random graphs with bounded average degree d {\textgreater} 1, and obtain several types of results. First, we use a dual witness construction (using the so-called non-backtracking matrix of the graph) to upper bound the SDP value. Second, we prove that a simple local algorithm approximately solves the SDP to within a factor 2d2/(2d2 + d − 1) of the upper bound. In particular, the local algorithm is at most 8/9 suboptimal, and 1 + O(1/d) suboptimal for large degree.},

The data are rich and reafﬁrm the importance of the cortical cytoskeleton, protein aggregates, and lipidomic complexity on the statistics of molecular encounters. Moreover, the data demand simulation approaches with a particular set of features, hence the ‘‘manifesto.’’ Together with the experimental data, simulations that satisfy these requirements hold the promise of a deeper understanding of membrane spatiotemporal organization. Several experimental breakthroughs in measuring molecular membrane dynamics are reviewed, the constraints that they place on simulations are discussed, and the status of simulation approaches that aim to meet them are detailed.},

	abstract = {We present a method to study rare nonadiabatic dynamics in open quantum systems using transition path sampling and quantum jump trajectories. As with applications of transition path sampling to classical dynamics, the method does not rely on prior knowledge of transition states or reactive pathways, and thus can provide mechanistic insight into ultrafast relaxation processes in addition to their associated rates. In particular, we formulate a quantum path ensemble using the stochastic realizations of an unravelled quantum master equation, which results in trajectories that can be conditioned on starting and ending in particular quantum states. Because the dynamics rigorously obeys detailed balance, rate constants can be evaluated from reversible work calculations in this conditioned ensemble, allowing for branching ratios and yields to be computed in an unbiased manner. We illustrate the utility of this method with three examples: energy transfer in a donor-bridge-acceptor model, and models of photo-induced proton-coupled electron transfer and thermally activated electron transfer. These examples demonstrate the efficacy of path ensemble methods and pave the way for their use in studying of complex reactive quantum dynamics.},

We show that CCPs are highly dynamic and can produce multiple vesicles in succession. Using alternating evanescent field and epifluorescence illumination, we show that CCP invagination and scission are tightly coupled, with scission coinciding with maximal displacement of CCPs from the plasma membrane and with peak recruitment of cortactin-DsRed, a dynamin and F-actin binding protein. Finally, perturbing actin polymerization with latrunculin-B drastically reduces the efficiency of membrane scission and affects many aspects of CCP dynamics. We propose that CCP invagination, actin polymerization, and CCV formation are highly coordinated for efficient endocytosis.},

Most effective SMC algorithms that are currently available for ABC have a computational complexity that is quadratic in the number of Monte Carlo samples (Beaumont et al., Biometrika 86:983–990, 2009; Peters et al., Technical report, 2008; Toni et al., J.

	abstract = {We study data-driven methods for supervised community detection on graphs. This estimation problem is typically formulated in terms of the spectrum of certain operators, as well as with posterior inference under certain probabilistic graphical models. Focusing on random graph families such as the Stochastic Block Model, recent research has uniﬁed both approaches, and identiﬁed both statistical and computational signal-to-noise detection thresholds. We identify the resulting class of algorithms with a family of Graph Neural Networks and show that they can reach those detection thresholds in a purely datadriven manner, without access to the underlying generative models and with no parameter assumptions. For that purpose, we propose to augment GNNs with the non-Backtracking operator, deﬁned on the line graph of edge adjacencies. We also perform the ﬁrst analysis of optimization landscape on a simpliﬁed GNN family, revealing an interesting transition from rugged to simple as the graph size increases. Finally, the resulting model is also tested on real datasets, performing signiﬁcantly better than rigid parametric models.},

The generative map from the latent space to the data space follows a dynamical system, where a learnable potential function guides a compressible ﬂuid to ﬂow towards the target density distribution. Training of the model amounts to solving an optimal control problem. The Monge-Ampe`re ﬂow has tractable likelihoods and supports efﬁcient sampling and inference. One can easily impose symmetry constraints in the generative model by designing suitable scalar potential functions. We apply the approach to unsupervised density estimation of the MNIST dataset and variational calculation of the two-dimensional Ising model at the critical point. This approach brings insights and techniques from Monge-Ampe`re equation, optimal transport, and ﬂuid dynamics into reversible ﬂow-based generative models.},

The second network represents the nonlinear dynamics and helps us distill the mechanisms that govern the evolution of a given spatiotemporal data-set. We test the eﬀectiveness of our approach for several benchmark problems spanning a number of scientiﬁc domains and demonstrate how the proposed framework can help us accurately learn the underlying dynamics and forecast future states of the system. In particular, we study the Burgers’, Korteweg-de Vries (KdV), Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, nonlinear Schr¨odinger, and Navier-Stokes equations.},

By exploring this simple question, we nd some interesting aspects of Importance Sampling that provide insight into its properties and have important implications. Both analytical and numerical results indicate that Importance Sampling estimates are heavily biased towards the assumed statistics, while the actual statistics have little or no e ect. The consequences of this behavior are two-pronged. If the mismatch between actual and assumed statistics is unknown to the programmer, as can arise under several scenarios, then the simulation result may be misleading. If, on the other hand, the mismatch is deliberate, then the result may be simpler simulations. That is, under certain conditions, the noise samples in an Importance Sampling simulation need not be generated precisely according to their theoretical density, potentially eliminating complex random number generation.},

To avoid these problems, we ﬁrst propose to use a discriminative component with stochastic inputs for increased noise ﬂexibility. We show how an efﬁcient Gibbs sampling procedure can marginalize the stochastic inputs when inferring missing labels in this model. Following this, we extend the discriminative component to be fully Bayesian and produce estimates of uncertainty in its parameter values.

We establish: 1) for multilayer feedforward relu networks, the global minimizer of a weakly-regularized cross-entropy loss has the maximum normalized margin among all networks, 2) as a result, increasing the over-parametrization improves the normalized margin and generalization error bounds for two-layer networks. In particular, an inﬁnite-size neural network enjoys the best generalization guarantees. The typical inﬁnite feature methods are kernel methods; we compare the neural net margin with that of kernel methods and construct natural instances where kernel methods have much weaker generalization guarantees. We validate this gap between the two approaches empirically. Finally, this inﬁnite-neuron viewpoint is also fruitful for analyzing optimization. We show that a perturbed gradient ﬂow on inﬁnite-size networks ﬁnds a global optimizer in polynomial time.},

A popular GAN formulation is based on the use of Wasserstein distance as a metric between probability distributions. Unfortunately, minimizing the Wasserstein distance between the data distribution and the generative model distribution is a computationally challenging problem as its objective is non-convex, non-smooth, and even hard to compute. In this work, we show that obtaining gradient information of the smoothed Wasserstein GAN formulation, which is based on regularized Optimal Transport (OT), is computationally effortless and hence one can apply ﬁrst order optimization methods to minimize this objective. Consequently, we establish theoretical convergence guarantee to stationarity for a proposed class of GAN optimization algorithms. Unlike the original non-smooth formulation, our algorithm only requires solving the discriminator to approximate optimality. We apply our method to learning MNIST digits as well as CIFAR-10 images. Our experiments show that our method is computationally efﬁcient and generates images comparable to the state of the art algorithms given the same architecture and computational power.},

In this work we implement cutting-edge Reinforcement Learning (RL) techniques and show that their performance rivals gradient-based optimal control methods at the task of finding short, high-fidelity driving protocols from an initial to a target state in non-integrable many-body quantum systems of interacting qubits. The quantum state preparation problem, viewed as an optimization problem, is shown to exhibit a spin-glass-like phase transition in the space of protocols as a function of the protocol duration. Our RL-aided approach helps identify variational protocols with nearly optimal fidelity, even in the glassy phase, where optimal state preparation appears exponentially hard. This study highlights the usefulness of RL for applications in out-of-equilibrium quantum physics.},

This analogy is used to explain the differences that exist between the fluctuations of equilibrium and nonequilibrium processes.

We provide sufficient conditions, based on the Radon-Nikodym derivative of Pn and Qn, for the set of typical values of Mn obtained relative to Pn to be the same as the set of typical values obtained relative to Qn in the limit n\$ınfty\$. This extends to general probability measures and stochastic processes the well-known thermodynamic-limit equivalence of the microcanonical and canonical ensembles, related mathematically to the asymptotic equivalence of conditional and exponentially-tilted measures. In this more general sense, two probability measures that are asymptotically equivalent predict the same typical or macroscopic properties of the system they are meant to model.},

	abstract = {Stochastic gradient Markov chain Monte Carlo (SG-MCMC) has been increasingly popular in Bayesian learning due to its ability to deal with large data. A standard SG-MCMC algorithm simulates samples from a discretized-time Markov chain to approximate a target distribution. However, the samples are typically highly correlated due to the sequential generation process, an undesired property in SG-MCMC. In contrary, Stein variational gradient descent (SVGD) directly optimizes a set of particles, and it is able to approximate a target distribution with much fewer samples. In this paper, we propose a novel method to directly optimize particles (or samples) in SG-MCMC from scratch. Specifically, we propose efficient methods to solve the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation on the space of probability distributions, whose solution (i.e., a distribution) is approximated by particles. Through our framework, we are able to show connections of SG-MCMC to SVGD, as well as the seemly unrelated generative-adversarial-net framework. Under certain relaxations, particle optimization in SG-MCMC can be interpreted as an extension of standard SVGD with momentum.},

	abstract = {Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC) has recently received considerable attention in the literature due to its ability to overcome the slow exploration of the parameter space inherent in random walk proposals. In tandem, data subsampling has been extensively used to overcome the computational bottlenecks in posterior sampling algorithms that require evaluating the likelihood over the whole data set, or its gradient. However, while data subsampling has been successful in traditional MCMC algorithms such as Metropolis-Hastings, it has been demonstrated to be unsuccessful in the context of HMC, both in terms of poor sampling efficiency and in producing highly biased inferences. We propose an efficient HMC-within-Gibbs algorithm that utilizes data subsampling to speed up computations and simulates from a slightly perturbed target, which is within O(m-2) of the true target, where m is the size of the subsample. We also show how to modify the method to obtain exact inference on any function of the parameters. Contrary to previous unsuccessful approaches, we perform subsampling in a way that conserves energy but for a modified Hamiltonian. We can therefore maintain high acceptance rates even for distant proposals. We apply the method for simulating from the posterior distribution of a high-dimensional spline model for bankruptcy data and document speed ups of several orders of magnitude compare to standard HMC and, moreover, demonstrate a negligible bias.},

	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.08741v2},
	abstract = {Background: Deep learning models are typically trained using stochastic gradient descent or one of its variants. These methods update the weights using their gradient, estimated from a small fraction of the training data. It has been observed that when using large batch sizes there is a persistent degradation in generalization performance - known as the "generalization gap" phenomena. Identifying the origin of this gap and closing it had remained an open problem. Contributions: We examine the initial high learning rate training phase. We find that the weight distance from its initialization grows logarithmically with the number of weight updates. We therefore propose a "random walk on random landscape" statistical model which is known to exhibit similar "ultra-slow" diffusion behavior. Following this hypothesis we conducted experiments to show empirically that the "generalization gap" stems from the relatively small number of updates rather than the batch size, and can be completely eliminated by adapting the training regime used. We further investigate different techniques to train models in the large-batch regime and present a novel algorithm named "Ghost Batch Normalization" which enables significant decrease in the generalization gap without increasing the number of updates. To validate our findings we conduct several additional experiments on MNIST, CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100 and ImageNet. Finally, we reassess common practices and beliefs concerning training of deep models and suggest they may not be optimal to achieve good generalization.

For Markov chains, this theory involves a non-linear relation between probability currents and their conjugate forces. Within this framework, we show how the forces can be split into two components, which are orthogonal to each other, in a generalised sense. This splitting allows a decomposition of the pathwise rate function into three terms, which have physical interpretations in terms of dissipation and convergence to equilibrium. Similar decompositions hold for rate functions at level 2 and level 2.5. These results clarify how bounds on entropy production and fluctuation theorems emerge from the underlying dynamical rules. We discuss how these results for Markov chains are related to similar structures within Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory, which describes hydrodynamic limits of such microscopic models.},

Handcrafted proposals that rely on user knowledge about the posterior distribution can be efficient, but are difficult to derive and implement. This paper proposes to let users express their posterior knowledge in the form of proposal programs, which are samplers written in probabilistic programming languages. One strategy for writing good proposal programs is to combine domain-specific heuristic algorithms with neural network models. The heuristics identify high probability regions, and the neural networks model the posterior uncertainty around the outputs of the algorithm. Proposal programs can be used as proposal distributions in importance sampling and Metropolis-Hastings samplers without sacrificing asymptotic consistency, and can be optimized offline using inference compilation. Support for optimizing and using proposal programs is easily implemented in a sampling-based probabilistic programming runtime. The paper illustrates the proposed technique with a proposal program that combines RANSAC and neural networks to accelerate inference in a Bayesian linear regression with outliers model.},

It provides an alternative to existing sampling methods such as inversion sampling, rejection sampling, Gaussian mixture models and Markov-Chain-Monte-Carlo. Our model has high sampling efficiency and is easily applied to any probability distribution, without the need of further analytical or numerical calculations. It can produce correlated samples, such that the output distribution converges faster towards the target than for independent samples. But it is also able to produce independent samples, if single values are fed into the network and the input values are independent as well. We focus on one-dimensional sampling, but additionally illustrate a two-dimensional example with a target distribution of dependent variables.},

This generalization facilitates applying the thermodynamic uncertainty relation to single molecule experiments, for which infinite timescales are not accessible. Importantly, often this finite-time variant of the relation allows inferring a bound on the entropy production that is even stronger than the one obtained from the long-time limit.

We report here the first example of efficiently self-assembled virus-like particles (VLPs) having a brome mosaic virus protein coat and a functionalized gold core. The present study indicates that functionalized gold particles can initiate VLP assembly by mimicking the electrostatic behavior of the nucleic acid component of the native virus. These VLP constructs are symmetric, with the protein stoichiometry and packaging properties indicating similarity to the icosahedral packing of the capsid. Moreover, a pH-induced swelling transition of the VLPs is observed, in direct analogy to the native virus.},

Starting from elementary examples and using the results of Gaveau and Schulman, we propose a simple expression for the configurational entropy and revisit the question of taking flat averages over metastable states. The construction is applicable to finite-dimensional systems, and we explicitly show that for simple mean-field glass models it recovers, justifies, and generalizes the known results. The calculation emphasises the appearance of new dynamical order parameters.},

Besides a discussion of design principles used to control linear and rotary motion in such molecular systems, this review will address the advances towards the construction of synthetic machines that can perform useful functions. Approaches taken by several research groups to construct wholly synthetic molecular machines and devices are compared. This will be illustrated with molecular rotors, elevators, valves, transporters, muscles and other motor functions used to develop smart materials. The demonstration of molecular machinery is highlighted through recent examples of systems capable of effecting macroscopic movement through concerted molecular motion. Several approaches to illustrate how molecular motor systems have been used to accomplish work are discussed.

We provide evidence that some such functions that are defined on high dimensional domains have a narrow band of values whose pre-image contains the bulk of its critical points. This is in contrast with the low dimensional picture in which this band is wide. Our simulations agree with the previous theoretical work on spin glasses that proves the existence of such a band when the dimension of the domain tends to infinity. Furthermore our experiments on teacher-student networks with the MNIST dataset establish a similar phenomenon in deep networks. We finally observe that both the gradient descent and the stochastic gradient descent methods can reach this level within the same number of steps.},

The cyanobacterial carboxysome is a proteinaceous microcompartment that protects and concentrates the carbon-fixing enzyme RuBisCO in a paracrystalline lattice, making it possible for these organisms to fix CO2 from the atmosphere. The protein responsible for the organization of this lattice in beta-type carboxysomes of the freshwater cyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus , CcmM, occurs in two isoforms thought to localize differentially within the carboxysome matrix. Here, we use widefield timelapse and 3D-structured illumination microscopy (3D-SIM) to study the recruitment and localization of these two isoforms. We demonstrate that this super-resolution technique is capable of successfully resolving the outer protein shell of the carboxysome from its internal cargo. We develop an automated analysis pipeline to analyze and quantify 3D-SIM images and generate a population level description of carboxysome shell protein, RuBisCO, and CcmM isoform localization. We find that both CcmM isoforms colocalize in space and time, prompting a revised model of the internal arrangement of the β-carboxysome.},

	abstract = {The incidence of rare events in fast-slow systems is investigated via analysis of the large deviation principle (LDP) that characterizes the likelihood and pathway of large fluctuations of the slow variables away from their mean behavior – such fluctuations are rare on short timescales but become ubiquitous eventually. This LDP involves an Hamilton-Jacobi equation whose Hamiltonian is related to the leading eigenvalue of the generator of the fast process, and is typically non-quadratic in the momenta – in other words, the LDP for the slow variables in fast-slow systems is different in general from that of any stochastic differential equation (SDE) one would write for the slow variables alone. It is shown here that the eigenvalue problem for the Hamiltonian can be reduced to a simpler algebraic equation for this Hamiltonian for a specific class of systems in which the fast variables satisfy a linear equation whose coefficients depend nonlinearly on the slow variables, and the fast variables enter quadratically the equation for the slow variables. These results are illustrated via examples, inspired by kinetic theories of turbulent flows and plasma, in which the quasipotential characterizing the long time behavior of the system is calculated and shown again to be different from that of an SDE.},

Expression of carboxysomes in E. coli resulted in the production of icosahedral complexes similar to those from the native host. In vivo, the complexes were capable of both assembling with carboxysomal proteins and fixing CO(2). Characterization of purified synthetic carboxysomes indicated that they were well formed in structure, contained the expected molecular components, and were capable of fixing CO(2) in vitro. In addition, we verify association of the postulated pore-forming protein CsoS1D with the carboxysome and show how it may modulate function.

	abstract = {The midpoint rule time discretization technique is applied to Landau–Lifshitz–Gilbert (LLG) equation. The technique is unconditionally stable and second-order accurate. It has the important property of preserving the conservation of magnetization amplitude of LLG dynamics. In addition, for typical forms of the micromagnetic free energy, the midpoint rule preserves the main energy balance properties of LLG dynamics. In fact, it preserves LLG Lyapunov structure and, in the case of zero damping, the system free energy. All the above preservation properties are fulfilled unconditionally, namely, regardless of the choice of the time step. The proposed technique is then tested on the standard micromagnetic problem No. 4. In the numerical computations, the magnetostatic field is computed by the fast Fourier transform method, and the nonlinear system of equations connected to the implicit time-stepping algorithm is solved by special and reasonably fast quasi-Newton technique.},

	abstract = {Background Cyanobacteria play a significant role in the global carbon cycle. In Synechococcus elongatus , the carbon-fixing enzyme ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) is concentrated into polyhedral, proteinaceous compartments called carboxysomes. Methodology/Principal Findings Using live cell fluorescence microscopy, we show that carboxysomes are first detected as small seeds of RuBisCO that colocalize with existing carboxysomes. These seeds contain little or no shell protein, but increase in RuBisCO content over several hours, during which time they are exposed to the solvent. The maturing seed is then enclosed by shell proteins, a rapid process that seals RuBisCO from the cytosol to establish a distinct, solvent-protected microenvironment that is oxidizing relative to the cytosol. These closure events can be spatially and temporally coincident with the appearance of a nascent daughter RuBisCO seed. Conclusions/Significance Carboxysomes assemble in a stepwise fashion, inside-to-outside, revealing that cargo is the principle organizer of this compartment’s biogenesis. Our observations of the spatial relationship of seeds to previously formed carboxysomes lead us to propose a model for carboxysome replication via sequential fission, polymerization, and encapsulation of their internal cargo.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1525145113},
	abstract = {Many carbon-fixing bacteria rely on a CO2 concentrating mechanism (CCM) to elevate the CO2 concentration around the carboxylating enzyme ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO). The CCM is postulated to simultaneously enhance the rate of carboxylation and minimize oxygenation, a competitive reaction with O2 also catalyzed by RuBisCO. To achieve this effect, the CCM combines two features: active transport of inorganic carbon into the cell and colocalization of carbonic anhydrase and RuBisCO inside proteinaceous microcompartments called carboxysomes. Understanding the significance of the various CCM components requires reconciling biochemical intuition with a quantitative description of the system. To this end, we have developed a mathematical model of the CCM to analyze its energetic costs and the inherent intertwining of physiology and pH. We find that intracellular pH greatly affects the cost of inorganic carbon accumulation. At low pH the inorganic carbon pool contains more of the highly cell-permeable H2CO3, necessitating a substantial expenditure of energy on transport to maintain internal inorganic carbon levels. An intracellular pH \${\textbackslash}approx\$8 reduces leakage, making the CCM significantly more energetically efficient. This pH prediction coincides well with our measurement of intracellular pH in a model cyanobacterium. We also demonstrate that CO2 retention in the carboxysome is necessary, whereas selective uptake of HCO3 (-) into the carboxysome would not appreciably enhance energetic efficiency. Altogether, integration of pH produces a model that is quantitatively consistent with cyanobacterial physiology, emphasizing that pH cannot be neglected when describing biological systems interacting with inorganic carbon pools.},

	abstract = {Imposing curvature on crystalline sheets, such as 2D packings of colloids or proteins, or covalently bonded graphene leads to distinct types of structural instabilities. The first type involves the proliferation of localized defects that disrupt the crystalline order without affecting the imposed shape, whereas the second type consists of elastic modes, such as wrinkles and crumples, which deform the shape and also are common in amorphous polymer sheets. Here, we propose a profound link between these types of patterns, encapsulated in a universal, compression-free stress field, which is determined solely by the macroscale confining conditions. This "stress universality" principle and a few of its immediate consequences are borne out by studying a circular crystalline patch bound to a deformable spherical substrate, in which the two distinct patterns become, respectively, radial chains of dislocations (called "scars") and radial wrinkles. The simplicity of this set-up allows us to characterize the morphologies and evaluate the energies of both patterns, from which we construct a phase diagram that predicts a wrinkle-scar transition in confined crystalline sheets at a critical value of the substrate stiffness. The construction of a unified theoretical framework that bridges inelastic crystalline defects and elastic deformations opens unique research directions. Beyond the potential use of this concept for finding energy-optimizing packings in curved topographies, the possibility of transforming defects into shape deformations that retain the crystalline structure may be valuable for a broad range of material applications, such as manipulations of graphene's electronic structure.},

Depending on the enzymes they encapsulate, BMCs function in either inorganic carbon fixation (carboxysomes) or organic carbon utilization (metabolosomes). The hallmark feature of all BMCs is a selectively permeable shell formed by multiple paralogous proteins, each proposed to confer specific flux characteristics. Gene clusters encoding diverse BMCs are distributed broadly across bacterial phyla, providing a rich variety of building blocks with a predicted range of permeability properties. In theory, shell permeability can be engineered by modifying residues flanking the pores (symmetry axes) of hexameric shell proteins or by combining shell proteins from different types of BMCs into chimeric shells. We undertook both approaches to altering shell properties using the carboxysome as a model system. There are two types of carboxysomes, α and β.

	abstract = {Bacterial microcompartments (MCPs) are sophisticated protein-based organelles used to optimize metabolic pathways. They consist of metabolic enzymes encapsulated within a protein shell, which creates an ideal environment for catalysis and facilitates the channeling of toxic/volatile intermediates to downstream enzymes. The metabolic processes that require MCPs are diverse and widely distributed and play important roles in global carbon fixation and bacterial pathogenesis. The protein shells of MCPs are thought to selectively control the movement of enzyme cofactors, substrates, and products (including toxic or volatile intermediates) between the MCP interior and the cytoplasm of the cell using both passive electrostatic/steric and dynamic gated mechanisms. Evidence suggests that specialized shell proteins conduct electrons between the cytoplasm and the lumen of the MCP and/or help rebuild damaged iron-sulfur centers in the encapsulated enzymes. The MCP shell is elaborated through a family of small proteins whose structural core is known as a bacterial microcompartment (BMC) domain. BMC domain proteins oligomerize into flat, hexagonally shaped tiles, which assemble into extended protein sheets that form the facets of the shell. Shape complementarity along the edges allows different types of BMC domain proteins to form mixed sheets, while sequence variation provides functional diversification. Recent studies have also revealed targeting sequences that mediate protein encapsulation within MCPs, scaffolding proteins that organize lumen enzymes and the use of private cofactor pools (NAD/H and coenzyme A [HS-CoA]) to facilitate cofactor homeostasis. Although much remains to be learned, our growing understanding of MCPs is providing a basis for bioengineering of protein-based containers for the production of chemicals/pharmaceuticals and for use as molecular delivery vehicles.},

	abstract = {When two populations of "particles" move in opposite directions, like oppositely charged colloids under an electric field or intersecting flows of pedestrians, they can move collectively, forming lanes along their direction of motion. The nature of this "laning transition" is still being debated and, in particular, the pair correlation functions, which are the key observables to quantify this phenomenon, have not been characterized yet. Here, we determine the correlations using an analytical approach based on a linearization of the stochastic equations for the density fields, which is valid for dense systems of soft particles. We find that the correlations decay algebraically along the direction of motion, and have a self-similar exponential profile in the transverse direction. Brownian dynamics simulations confirm our theoretical predictions and show that they also hold beyond the validity range of our analytical approach, pointing to a universal behavior.

	abstract = {Fluctuations arise universally in nature as a reflection of the discrete microscopic world at the macroscopic level. Despite their apparent noisy origin, fluctuations encode fundamental aspects of the physics of the system at hand, crucial to understand irreversibility and nonequilibrium behavior. To sustain a given fluctuation, a system traverses a precise optimal path in phase space. Here we show that by demanding invariance of optimal paths under symmetry transformations, new and general fluctuation relations valid arbitrarily far from equilibrium are unveiled. This opens an unexplored route toward a deeper understanding of nonequilibrium physics by bringing symmetry principles to the realm of fluctuations. We illustrate this concept studying symmetries of the current distribution out of equilibrium. In particular we derive an isometric fluctuation relation that links in a strikingly simple manner the probabilities of any pair of isometric current fluctuations. This relation, which results from the time-reversibility of the dynamics, includes as a particular instance the Gallavotti-Cohen fluctuation theorem in this context but adds a completely new perspective on the high level of symmetry imposed by time-reversibility on the statistics of nonequilibrium fluctuations. The new symmetry implies remarkable hierarchies of equations for the current cumulants and the nonlinear response coefficients, going far beyond Onsager's reciprocity relations and Green-Kubo formulas. We confirm the validity of the new symmetry relation in extensive numerical simulations, and suggest that the idea of symmetry in fluctuations as invariance of optimal paths has far-reaching consequences in diverse fields.},

We have incorporated it into a 2D, stochastic computer model to study lamellipodia via the self-organization of filament orientation patterns. Essential dendritic-nucleation submodels were incorporated, including discretized actin monomer diffusion, Monte-Carlo filament kinetics, and flexible filament and plasma membrane mechanics. Model parameters were estimated from the literature and simulation, providing values for the extent of the leading edge-branching/capping-protective zone (5.4 nm) and the autocatalytic branch rate (0.43/sec). For a given set of parameters, the system evolved to a steady-state filament count and velocity, at which total branching and capping rates were equal only for specific orientations; net capping eliminated others. The standard parameter set evoked a sharp preference for the +/-35 degree filaments seen in lamellipodial electron micrographs, requiring approximately 12 generations of successive branching to adapt to a 15 degree change in protrusion direction. This pattern was robust with respect to membrane surface and bending energies and to actin concentrations but required protection from capping at the leading edge and branching angles {\textgreater}60 degrees. A +70/0/-70 degree pattern was formed with flexible filaments approximately 100 nm or longer and with velocities {\textless} approximately 20\% of free polymerization rates.},

	abstract = {Bacterial microcompartments are organelles composed of a protein shell that surrounds functionally related proteins. Bioinformatic analysis of sequenced genomes indicates that homologs to shell protein genes are widespread among bacteria and suggests that the shell proteins are capable of encapsulating diverse enzymes. The carboxysome is a bacterial microcompartment that enhances CO(2) fixation in cyanobacteria and some chemoautotrophs by sequestering ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and carbonic anhydrase in the microcompartment shell. Here, we report the in vitro and in vivo characterization of CcmN, a protein of previously unknown function that is absolutely conserved in β-carboxysomal gene clusters. We show that CcmN localizes to the carboxysome and is essential for carboxysome biogenesis. CcmN has two functionally distinct regions separated by a poorly conserved linker. The N-terminal portion of the protein is important for interaction with CcmM and, by extension, ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase and the carbonic anhydrase CcaA, whereas the C-terminal peptide is essential for interaction with the carboxysome shell. Deletion of the peptide abolishes carboxysome formation, indicating that its interaction with the shell is an essential step in microcompartment formation. Peptides with similar length and sequence properties to those in CcmN can be bioinformatically detected in a large number of diverse proteins proposed to be encapsulated in functionally distinct microcompartments, suggesting that this peptide and its interaction with its cognate shell proteins are common features of microcompartment assembly.},

On the other hand, when a system is driven far from equilibrium, this relation is violated in general because the detailed-balance condition is not satisfied in nonequilibrium systems. Even in this case, it has been found that for a class of Langevin equations, there exists an equality between the extent of violation of the fluctuation-response relation in the nonequilibrium steady state and the rate of energy dissipation from the system into the environment [T. Harada and S.-i. Sasa, Phys. Rev. Lett. 95, 130602 (2005)]. Since this equality involves only experimentally measurable quantities, it serves as a proposition to determine experimentally whether the system can be described by a Langevin equation. Furthermore, the contribution of each degree of freedom to the rate of energy dissipation can be determined based on this equality. In this paper, we present a comprehensive description on this equality, and provide a detailed derivation for various types of models including many-body systems, Brownian motor models, time-dependent systems, and systems with multiple heat reservoirs.},

For these particles, the Smoluchowski equation can be solved analytically using Green’s functions. The main idea of GFRD is to exploit the exact solution of the Smoluchoswki equation to set up an event-driven algorithm, which combines in one step the propagation of the particles in space with the reactions between them. The event-driven nature allows GFRD to make large jumps in time and space when the particles are far apart from each other. Here, we apply the technique to a simple model of gene expression.

We compare our results with appropriate generalizations of classical (i.e., continuum) elasticity theory.

At the core of the theory lies the minimization of an action functional, which in many cases of interest has to be computed by numerical means. Here we review the theoretical and computational aspects behind these calculations, and propose an algorithm that simplifies the geometric minimum action method introduced in [M. Heymann and E. Vanden-Eijnden, CPAM Vol. LXI, 1052-1117 (2008)] to minimize the action in the space of arc-length parametrized curves. We then illustrate this algorithm's capabilities by applying it to various examples from material sciences, fluid dynamics, atmosphere/ocean sciences, and reaction kinetics. In terms of models, these examples involve stochastic (ordinary or partial) differential equations with multiplicative or degenerate noise, Markov jump processes, and systems with fast and slow degrees of freedom, which all violate detailed balance, so that simpler computational methods are not applicable.},

Methodology/Principal Findings To analyze the role of RubisCO in carboxysome biogenesis in vivo we have created a series of Halothiobacillus neapolitanus RubisCO mutants. We identified the large subunit of the enzyme as an important determinant for its sequestration into α-carboxysomes and found that the carboxysomes of H. neapolitanus readily incorporate chimeric and heterologous RubisCO species. Intriguingly, a mutant lacking carboxysomal RubisCO assembles empty carboxysome shells of apparently normal shape and composition. Conclusions/Significance These results indicate that carboxysome shell architecture is not determined by the enzyme they normally sequester. Our study provides, for the first time, clear evidence that carboxysome contents can be manipulated and suggests future nanotechnological applications that are based upon engineered protein microcompartments.},

	doi = {10.7554/eLife.00632},
	abstract = {Viruses are infectious agents made up of proteins and a genome made of DNA or RNA. Upon infecting a host cell, viruses hijack the cell’s gene expression machinery and force it to produce copies of the viral genome and proteins, which then assemble into new viruses that can eventually infect other host cells. Because assembly is an essential step in the viral life cycle, understanding how this process occurs could significantly advance the fight against viral diseases. In many viral families, a protein shell called a capsid forms around the viral genome during the assembly process. However, capsids can also assemble around nucleic acids in solution, indicating that a host cell is not required for their formation. Since capsid proteins are positively charged, and nucleic acids are negatively charged, electrostatic interactions between the two are thought to have an important role in capsid assembly. However, it is unclear how structural features of the viral genome affect assembly, and why the negative charge on viral genomes is actually far greater than the positive charge on capsids. These questions are difficult to address experimentally because most of the intermediates that form during virus assembly are too short-lived to be imaged. Here, Perlmutter et al. have used state of the art computational methods and advances in graphical processing units (GPUs) to produce the most realistic model of capsid assembly to date. They showed that the stability of the complex formed between the nucleic acid and the capsid depends on the length of the viral genome. Yield was highest for genomes within a certain range of lengths, and capsids that assembled around longer or shorter genomes tended to be malformed. Perlmutter et al. also explored how structural features of the virus—including base-pairing between viral nucleic acids, and the size and charge of the capsid—determine the optimal length of the viral genome. When they included structural data from real viruses in their simulations and predicted the optimal lengths for the viral genome, the results were very similar to those seen in existing viruses. This indicates that the structure of the viral genome has been optimized to promote packaging into capsids. Understanding this relationship between structure and packaging will make it easier to develop antiviral agents that thwart or misdirect virus assembly, and could aid the redesign of viruses for use in gene therapy and drug delivery.},

The obtained expressions originate from the Morozova, Chencov and Petz correspondence of monotone metrics to operator monotone functions. The used mathematical technique provides analytical expansions in terms of the thermodynamic mean values of iterated (nested) commutators of a model Hamiltonian T with the operator S involved through the control parameter \$h\$. Due to the sum rules for the frequency moments of the dynamic structure factor new presentations for the monotone Riemannian metrics are obtained. Particularly, relations between any monotone Riemannian metric and the usual thermodynamic susceptibility or the variance of the operator S are discussed. If the symmetry properties of the Hamiltonian are given in terms of generators of some Lie algebra, the obtained expansions may be evaluated in a closed form. These issues are tested on a class of model systems studied in condensed matter physics.},

However, the insertion of the final subunits is the rate-limiting, energetically unfavorable step in viral capsid assembly.

Our bound involves a measure of partial entropy production, that we interpret as the least amount of entropy that a system sustaining current J can possibly produce, at a given steady state. We provide a complete mathematical discussion of quadratic bounds which allows one to determine which are optimal, and finally we argue that the relationship for the Fano factor of the entropy production rate varσ/meanσ\${\textbackslash}ge\$2 is the most significant realization of the loose bound. We base our analysis both on the formalism of diffusions, and of Markov jump processes in the light of Schnakenberg's cycle analysis.},

Since the membrane influences the cell dynamics on multiple levels and provides a nontrivial feedback, we consider the following fundamental interactions: (i) the reduction of the actin polymerization rate by membrane tension; (ii) area conservation of the cell's two-dimensional cross-section vs. conservation of its circumference (i.e. membrane inextensibility); and (iii) the contribution from the membrane's bending energy to the shape and integrity of the cell. As in experiments, we investigate two pertinent observables – the cell's velocity and its aspect ratio. We find that the most important effect is the feedback of membrane tension on the actin polymerization. Bending rigidity has only minor effects, visible mostly in dynamic reshaping events, as exemplified by collisions of the cell with an obstacle.},

Our findings are consistent with a possible relation between the previously hypothesized liquid-liquid phase transition and the transition in the dynamics recently observed in neutron scattering experiments on confined water. More generally, we argue that this connection between C(P)(max) and dynamic crossover is not limited to the case of water, a hydrogen bond network-forming liquid, but is a more general feature of crossing the Widom line. Specifically, we also study the Jagla potential, a spherically symmetric two-scale potential known to possess a liquid-liquid critical point, in which the competition between two liquid structures is generated by repulsive and attractive ramp interactions.},

Including the inertia term, we show that this feature not only persists but that even delta-peak-like changes of the control parameter at both boundaries make the process optimal. These results are obtained by analyzing two simple paradigmatic cases: First, a Brownian particle dragged by a harmonic optical trap through a viscous fluid and, second, a Brownian particle subject to an optical trap with time-dependent stiffness.

Then the probability under the uniform law W\_n on self-avoiding walks Gamma of any given odd length n beginning at the origin that Gamma closes – i.e., that Gamma's endpoint is a neighbour of the origin – is given by W\_n ( Gamma closes ) = 2(n+1) p\_n+1/c\_n. The polygon and walk cardinalities share a common exponential growth: lim\_n c\_n{\textasciicircum}1/n = lim\_n even p\_n{\textasciicircum}1/n = mu (where the common value mu is called the connective constant). Madras [26] has shown that p\_n is at most C n{\textasciicircum}-1/2 mu{\textasciicircum}n in dimension d=2, while the closing probability was recently shown in [13] to satisfy W\_n ( Gamma closes ) is at most n{\textasciicircum}-1/4 + o(1) in any dimension d at least two.

However, structures of similar polyhedral shape are being discovered in an ever-increasing number of heterotrophic bacteria, where they participate in the utilization of specialty carbon and energy sources. Comparative genomics reveals that the potential for this type of compartmentalization is widespread across bacterial phyla and suggests that genetic modules encoding BMCs are frequently laterally transferred among bacteria.

We show that its residual term converges to zero, justifying the use of a truncation—running only a short Gibbs chain, which is the main idea behind the contrastive divergence (CD) estimator of the log-likelihood gradient. By truncating even more, we obtain a stochastic reconstruction error, related through a mean-field approximation to the reconstruction error often used to train autoassociators and stacked autoassociators.

The long term stochastic dynamics on the manifold will be completely characterized by the long term density ρ and the long term current density J. As such, control problems may be reformulated as variational problems over ρ and J. We discuss several optimization problems: the problem in which both ρ and J are varied freely, the problem in which ρ is fixed and the one in which J is fixed. These problems lead to different kinds of operator problems: linear PDEs in the first two cases and a nonlinear PDE in the latter case. These results are obtained through through variational principle using infinite dimensional Lagrange multipliers. In the case where the initial dynamics are reversible we obtain the result that the optimally controlled diffusion is also symmetrizable. The particular case of constraining the dynamics to be reversible of the optimally controlled process leads to a linear eigenvalue problem for the square root of the density process.},

A statistically significant kinetic effect of coencapsulated CA on RuBisCO activity was not observed under ambient or oxygen saturated conditions, suggesting that enzyme proximity alone may not be the key determinant in carboxysome function. The capsid shell protected the enzyme from proteolytic damage, a factor that could have provided early cyanobacteria with an evolutionary benefit. Our strategy to coencapsulate different proteins can easily be extended to other sequentially acting enzymes and lays down principles for developing artificial organelles to control biosynthetic pathways in vivo.},

	abstract = {Soft materials consist of basic units that are significantly larger than an atom but much smaller than the overall dimensions of the sample. The label "soft condensed matter" emphasizes that the large basic building blocks of these materials produce low elastic moduli that govern a material's ability to withstand deformations. Aside from softness, there are many other properties that are also caused by the large size of the constituent building blocks. Soft matter is dissipative, disordered, far-from-equilibrium, non-linear, thermal and entropic, slow, observable, gravity-affected, patterned, non-local, interfacially elastic and active. This is only a partial list of how matter created from large component particles is distinct from "hard matter" composed of constituents at an atomic scale. Issues inherent in soft matter raise problems that are broadly important in diverse areas of science and require multiple modes of attack. For example, far-from-equilibrium behavior is confronted in biology, chemistry, geophysics, astrophysics and nuclear physics. Similarly, issues dealing with disorder appear broadly throughout many branches of inquiry wherever rugged landscapes are invoked. This article reviews the discussions that occurred during a workshop held on January 30-31, 2016 in which opportunities in soft-matter experiment were surveyed. Soft matter has had an exciting history of discovery and continues to be a fertile ground for future research.},

We then extend these results to the case of more than one hidden layer. Our theoretical guarantees assume essentially nothing on the training data, and are verified numerically.

Both the MRT and the SD significantly depend on the angle between the reversal magnetic field and the anisotropy axis. In comparison with the uniaxial symmetry case at the optimal angle \${\textbackslash}ensuremathþeta=45ıfmmode{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ{\textbackslash}else°{\textbackslash}fi\$, the MRT can be decreased from a factor of seven up to two orders of magnitude, and the jitter can be decreased from one to three orders of magnitude for damping \${\textbackslash}ensuremath{\textbackslash}alpha\$ ranging from 1 to 0.01. It is demonstrated that for \${\textbackslash}ensuremathþeta=5ıfmmode{\textasciicircum}{\textbackslash}circ{\textbackslash}else°{\textbackslash}fi\$ the increase in temperature from 4 to 300 K leads to doubling the MRT due to the noise-delayed switching effect.},

Using the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we show by direct calculation that the amount of energy dissipated during nanomagnet erasure approaches Landauer's thermodynamic limit of \$kT{\textbackslash}mathrmln (2)\$ with high precision when the external magnetic fields are applied slowly. In addition, we find that nanomagnet systems behave according to generalized formulations of Landauer's principle that hold for small systems and generic logic operations. In all cases, the results are independent of the anisotropy energy of the nanomagnet. Lastly, we apply our computational approach to a nanomagnet majority logic gate, where we find that dissipationless, reversible computation can be achieved when the magnetic fields are applied in the appropriate order.},

For non-equilibrium systems, we derived a generalized FDT that the response function is composed of two parts: (1) a spontaneous correlation representing the relaxation which is present in the near equilibrium systems with detailed balance and (2) a correlation related to the persistence of the curl flux in steady state, which is also in part linked to a internal curvature of a gauge field. The generalized FDT is also related to the fluctuation theorem.

	abstract = {Neural networks provide a rich class of high-dimensional, non-convex optimization problems. Despite their non-convexity, gradient-descent methods often successfully optimize these models. This has motivated a recent spur in research attempting to characterize properties of their loss surface that may be responsible for such success. In particular, several authors have noted that over-parametrization appears to act as a remedy against non-convexity. In this paper, we address this phenomenon by studying key topological properties of the loss, such as the presence or absence of "spurious valleys", defined as connected components of sub-level sets that do not include a global minimum. Focusing on a class of two-layer neural networks defined by smooth (but generally non-linear) activation functions, our main contribution is to prove that as soon as the hidden layer size matches the intrinsic dimension of the reproducing space, defined as the linear functional space generated by the activations, no spurious valleys exist, thus allowing the existence of descent directions. Our setup includes smooth activations such as polynomials, both in the empirical and population risk, and generic activations in the empirical risk case.},

To understand the formation and evolution of these features in a minimal setting, we consider a simple assay: the response of curved surfaces to point indentation. We find that for surfaces with zero or positive Gauss curvature, a common feature of the response is the appearance of faceted structures that are organized in intricate localized patterns, with hysteretic transitions between multiple metastable states. In contrast, for surfaces with negative Gauss curvature the surface deforms nonlocally along characteristic lines that extend through the entire system. These different responses may be understood quantitatively by using numerical simulations and classified qualitatively by using simple geometric ideas. Our ideas have implications for the behavior of small-scale structures.},

We formulate a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling process, equivalent to iteratively decoding and encoding, which allows us to sample from the learned latent distribution. Since, the generative model learns to map from the learned latent distribution, rather than the prior, we may use MCMC to improve the quality of samples drawn from the generative model, especially when the learned latent distribution is far from the prior. Using MCMC sampling, we are able to reveal previously unseen differences between generative autoencoders trained either with or without a denoising criterion.},

By viewing a Langevin process on a compact oriented manifold of arbitrary dimension m as a theory of a random vector field associated with the environment, we are able to consider stochastic motion of higher-dimensional objects, which allow new observables, called higher-dimensional currents, to be introduced. These higher dimensional currents arise by counting intersections of a k-dimensional trajectory, produced by a evolving (k-1)-dimensional cycle, with a reference cross section, represented by a cycle of complimentary dimension (m - k). We further express the mean fluxes in terms of the solutions of the Supersymmetric Fokker-Planck (SFP), thus generalizing the corresponding well-known expressions for the conventional currents.},

The spatial organization of the component particles in this shell is similar to the capsomer proteins forming the capsid of a \$T=1\$ virus. Growth occurs in the presence of an atomistic solvent and, under suitable conditions, achieves a high yield of complete shells. The simulations provide details of the structure and lifetime of the particle clusters that appear as intermediate states along the growth pathway, and the nature of the transitions between them. In certain respects the growth of size-60 shells from trapezoidal particles resembles the growth of icosahedral shells from triangular particles studied previously, with reversible bonding playing a major role in avoiding incorrect assembly, although the details differ due to particle shape and bond organization. The strong preference for maximal bonding exhibited by the triangular particle clusters is also apparent for trapezoidal particles, but this is now confined to early growth and is less pronounced as shells approach completion along a variety of pathways.},

Even though CP is believed to be critical for creating the lamellipodial actin structure necessary for protrusion and migration, CP's role in mammalian cell migration has not been directly tested. Moreover, recent studies have suggested that structures besides lamellipodia, including lamella and filopodia, may have unappreciated roles in cell migration. CP has been postulated to be absent from filopodia, and thus its role in filopodial activity has remained unexplored. We report that silencing CP in both cultured mammalian B16F10 cells and in neurons of developing neocortex impaired cell migration. Moreover, we unexpectedly observed that low levels of CP were detectable in the majority of filopodia. CP depletion decreased filopodial length, altered filopodial shape, and reduced filopodial dynamics. Our results support an expansion of the potential roles that CP plays in cell motility by implicating CP in filopodia as well as in lamellipodia, both of which are important for locomotion in many types of migrating cells.},

Coupling between the spins is introduced through the assumption that the transition probabilities for any one spin depend on the values of the neighboring spins. This dependence is determined, in part, by the detailed balancing condition obeyed by the equilibrium state of the model. The Markoff process which describes the spin functions is analyzed in detail for the case of a closed N-member chain. The expectation values of the individual spins and of the products of pairs of spins, each of the pair evaluated at a different time, are found explicitly. The influence of a uniform, time-varying magnetic field upon the model is discussed, and the frequency-dependent magnetic susceptibility is found in the weak-field limit.

The site of CO 2 -concentration is a protein bound micro-compartment called the carboxysome which contains most, if not all, of the cellular RuBisCO. The shell of β-type carboxysomes is thought to be composed of two functional layers, with the inner layer involved in RuBisCO scaffolding and bicarbonate dehydration, and the outer layer in selective permeability to dissolved solutes. Here, four genes ( ccmK2-4, ccmO ), whose products were predicted to function in the outer shell layer of β-carboxysomes from Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942, were investigated by analysis of defined genetic mutants. Deletion of the ccmK2 and ccmO genes resulted in severe high-CO 2 -requiring mutants with aberrant carboxysomes, whilst deletion of ccmK3 or ccmK4 resulted in cells with wild-type physiology and normal ultrastructure. However, a tandem deletion of ccmK3-4 resulted in cells with wild-type carboxysome structure, but physiologically deficient at low CO 2 conditions. These results revealed the minimum structural determinants of the outer shell of β-carboxysomes from this strain: CcmK2, CcmO and CcmL. An accessory set of proteins was required to refine the function of the pre-existing shell: CcmK3 and CcmK4. These data suggested a model for the facet structure of β-carboxysomes with CcmL forming the vertices, CcmK2 forming the bulk facet, and CcmO, a “zipper protein,” interfacing the edges of carboxysome facets.},

High processivity, the ability to take many steps along a track before dissociating, is often a desirable characteristic because it allows nanoscale motors to transport cargoes over distances on the scale of micrometres, in vivo and in vitro. Natural processive myosins are dimeric and use internal tension to coordinate the detachment cycles of the two heads. Here, we show that processivity can be enhanced in engineered myosins using two non-natural strategies designed to optimize the effectiveness of random, uncoordinated stepping: (1) the formation of three-headed and four-headed myosins and (2) the introduction of flexible elements between heads. We quantify improvements using systematic single-molecule characterization of a panel of engineered motors. To test the modularity of our approach, we design a controllably bidirectional myosin that is robustly processive in both forward and backward directions, and also produce the fastest processive cytoskeletal motor measured so far, reaching a speed of 10 µm s(-1).},

Establishing constraints on the assembly pathways is crucial to building reliable theoretical models. For example, it is currently an open question to what degree overall assembly kinetics are dominated by one or a few most efficient pathways versus the enormous number theoretically possible. The importance of this question, however, is often overlooked due to the difficulties of addressing it in either theoretical or experimental practice. We apply a computer model based on a discrete-event simulation method to evaluate the contributions of nondominant pathways to overall assembly kinetics. This is accomplished by comparing two possible assembly models: one allowing growth to proceed only by the accretion of individual assembly subunits and the other allowing the binding of sterically compatible assembly intermediates any sizes. Simulations show that the two models perform almost identically under low binding rate conditions, where growth is strongly nucleation-limited, but sharply diverge under conditions of higher association rates or coat protein concentrations. The results suggest the importance of identifying the actual binding pattern if one is to build reliable models of capsid assembly or other complex self-assembly processes.},

Training RBMs remains problematic however, because of the intractibility of their partition function. The maximum likelihood gradient requires a very robust sampler which can accurately sample from the model despite the loss of ergodicity often incurred during learning. While using Parallel Tempering in the negative phase of Stochastic Maximum Likelihood (SML-PT) helps address the issue, it imposes a trade-off between computational complexity and high ergodicity, and requires careful hand-tuning of the temperatures. In this paper, we show that this trade-off is unnecessary. The choice of optimal temperatures can be automated by minimizing average return time (a concept first proposed by [Katzgraber et al., 2006]) while chains can be spawned dynamically, as needed, thus minimizing the computational overhead. We show on a synthetic dataset, that this results in better likelihood scores.},

We further define the structural foundations of signaling from the central phosphotransferase, ChpT, to its response regulator substrate, CtrA, and provide evidence that there are at least two modes of interaction between ChpT and CtrA, only one of which is competent to catalyze phosphoryltransfer. The structure and dynamics of the active site on each side of the ChpT homodimer are distinct, supporting a model in which quaternary structure of the 2:2 ChpT-CtrA complex enforces an asymmetric mechanism of phosphoryl transfer between ChpT and CtrA. Our study provides mechanistic understanding, from the cellular to the atomic scale, of a conserved transcriptional regulatory system that controls the cellular and infection biology of B. abortus. More generally, our results provide insight into the structural basis of two-component signal transduction, which is broadly conserved in bacteria, plants, and fungi.},

	abstract = {We explore how thermal fluctuations affect the mechanics of thin amorphous spherical shells. In flat membranes with a shear modulus, thermal fluctuations increase the bending rigidity and reduce the in-plane elastic moduli in a scale-dependent fashion. This is still true for spherical shells. However, the additional coupling between the shell curvature, the local in-plane stretching modes and the local out-of-plane undulations, leads to novel phenomena. In spherical shells thermal fluctuations produce a radius-dependent negative effective surface tension, equivalent to applying an inward external pressure. By adapting renormalization group calculations to allow for a spherical background curvature, we show that while small spherical shells are stable, sufficiently large shells are crushed by this thermally generated "pressure". Such shells can be stabilized by an outward osmotic pressure, but the effective shell size grows non-linearly with increasing outward pressure, with the same universal power law exponent that characterizes the response of fluctuating flat membranes to a uniform tension.},

Fluctuations in the components of these regulatory networks result in noise that invariably corrupts the signal, possibly compromising function. Here, we create a practical formalism based on ideas introduced by Wiener and Kolmogorov (WK) for filtering noise in engineered communications systems to quantitatively assess the extent to which noise can be controlled in biological processes involving negative feedback. Application of the theory, which reproduces the previously proven scaling of the lower bound for noise suppression in terms of the number of signaling events, shows that a tetracycline repressor-based negative-regulatory gene circuit behaves as a WK filter. For the class of Hill-like nonlinear regulatory functions, this type of filter provides the optimal reduction in noise. Our theoretical approach can be readily combined with experimental measurements of response functions in a wide variety of genetic circuits, to elucidate the general principles by which biological networks minimize noise.},

Strong bending stiffness favors smooth, nearly spherical shapes, while weak bending stiffness leads to a sharply faceted icosahedral shape. Based on the phonon spectrum of a simplified mass-and-spring model of the shell, we interpret the transition from smooth to faceted as a soft-mode transition. In contrast to the case of a disclinated planar network where the transition is sharply defined, the mean curvature of the sphere smooths the transition. We define elastic susceptibilities as the response to forces applied at vertices, edges, and faces of an icosahedron. At the soft-mode transition the vertex susceptibility is the largest, but as the shell becomes more faceted the edge and face susceptibilities greatly exceed the vertex susceptibility. Limiting behaviors of the susceptibilities are analyzed and related to the ridge-scaling behavior of elastic sheets. Our results apply to virus capsids, liposomes with crystalline order, and other shell-like structures with icosahedral symmetry.},

Unlike spherical viruses, the structure of these prolates is not yet well understood, and only a few of them have been fully characterized. We present the results of a simple phenomenological model, which describes the remarkable structures of prolate or bacilliform viral shells. Surprisingly, we find that the special well-defined geometry of these elongated viruses arises just as a consequence of free-energy minimization of a generic interaction between the structural units of the capsid. Hemispherical T-number caps centered along the 5-, 3-, and 2-fold axes with hexagonally ordered cylindrical bodies are found to be local energy minima, thus justifying their occurrence as optimal viral structures. Moreover, closed elongated viruses show a sequence of magic numbers for the end-caps, leading to strict selection rules for the length and structure of the body as well as for the number of capsomers and proteins of the capsid. The model reproduces the architecture of spherical and bacilliform viruses, both in vivo and in vitro, and constitutes an important step towards understanding viral assembly and its potential control for biological and nanotechnological applications.},

	abstract = {Cytoskeletal dynamics is key to cellular function. At very short time scales, thermal motions probably dominate, whereas on time scales from minutes to hours, motor-protein-12–based directed transport is dominant. But what about the times in between? Fakhri et al. tracked kinesin molecules labeled with carbon nanotubes and monitored their motion in living cells for milliseconds to hours. The kinesins motored along microtubule tracks, but sometimes moved more randomly as the tracks themselves were moved by active, larger-scale cell movements. This active “stirring” of the cytoplasm may play a role in nonspecific transport. Science , this issue p. [1031][1] [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1250170},
